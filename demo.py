This file will be testing Galactica being used in tandem with pdf_parser to extra descriptions of chemical separations from research papers.
Author: Logan Endes https://github.com/Log45

Goals: Using few-shot CoT, answer these questions with different prompts
    - What is the target?
    - What is the target disolved in?
    - What is the resin (column) used?
    - What is the column eluted with?
    - What are the products?
    - (maybe) How long was the target irradiated?
    - (maybe) How long did the separation process take?
