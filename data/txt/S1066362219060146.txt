For producing 203Pb, natTl was electroplated on copper backing as target and was bombarded by energetic proton beam. After bom- bardment, the target was dissolved in 1 M HNO3. Ion exchange, solvent extraction, and nanomagnetic ion-imprinted polymer methods were used for separating 203Pb from thallium. The separation efficiency of these methods was studied. γ-Ray spectroscopy was applied for evaluating 203Pb and others radionuclides. The separation efficiency was determined from the γ-ray spectra. The separation efficiency of the methods us- ing ion exchange, solvent extraction, and nanomagnetic ion-imprinted adsorbent was 98, 99.3, and 96.4%, re- spectively. natural thallium [1]. Natural thallium contains 29.5% 203Tl and 70.5% 205Tl. The possible nuclear reactions and their threshold energies to produce 203Pb from natural thallium are listed in Table 1. Horlock et al. reported the use of solvent extraction for separating lead and iron [1]. Garmestani et al. de- scribed a simple and rapid method for purification of cyclotron-produced 203Pb using a commercially avail- able Pb(II)-selective ion-exchange resin [3]. Numerous studies on ion-imprinted polymers and their manipula-  There are at least three criteria in choosing the ra- dioactive isotope for in vivo and in vitro tracer studies. The radiation should be easy detectable; the half-life of the radioisotope should be neither too short nor too long; and the cost of the radioisotope should be moder- ate [1]. Lead-203 has a very simple decay mode (Fig. 1). It decays by electron capture followed by emission of γ-rays with energies of 279 (81%), 401 (5%), and 680 keV (0.9%). 203Pb with a half-life of 52 h is poten- tially useful for clinical scanning. High specific activ- ity and radiochemical purity of 203Pb are important for radiolabeling. 1–5 mCi of 203Pb radioisotope contains a trace amount of lead, which is less than 0.1% of the normal daily lead intake [2]. There are a number of methods for the 203Pb production [2–5]. Lead-203 is produced from either mercury or thal- lium target. Natural mercury has six stable isotopes. Several radionuclides of lead and thallium can be pro- duced by bombardment of natural mercury with 3He or 4He particles. Separation of 203Pb using this method is very difficult. The use of enriched mercury as a target material could partially solve this problem, but the cost of the obtained 203Pb will be very high. Therefore, the preferred target material for the production of 203Pb is    tion for selective separation of lead ions have been reported [6–14]. In this work, we considered produc- tion of 203Pb by proton bombardment of natural thal- lium and its purification by conventional ion exchange, ion- solvent extraction, and novel nanomagnetic imprinted polymer methods. Materials and equipment. Thallium(I) sulfate (99.9%) was purchased from UCB (Union Chimique Belge). Lead nitrate was purchased from Fluka. Stan- dard 1000 mg L−1 solutions of lead and thallium were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. All the other chemi- cals were purchased from Merck. Cu backings were produced in our workshop. All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade and were used without fur- ther purification. Working solutions of Pb and Tl were prepared by diluting appropriate amounts of the stock solutions. A Hydro Ultrapure water purification system was used for making deionized water needed to prepare all the required solutions. An HPGe detector system (CanberraTM, GC1020-7500SL) in conjugation with a PC-based MCA and A Metrohm 827 pH meter was used. Target preparation. Natural thallium(I) sulfate (Tl2SO4), was chosen as the target material. High- quality thallium targets (70 μm) were prepared by elec- trodeposition of 1 g of Tl on 12 cm2 copper backings. The first plating bath is prepared by dissolving a por- tion of natTl2SO4 in an aqueous alkaline solution con- taining EDTA as a complexing agent, hydrazine hy- drate as an anodic depolarizer, and Brij-35 as a wetting agent. Constant-current electrolysis was carried out by applying a bipolar chopped saw-tooth voltage between the Pt anode and copper cathode. Target irradiation. The proton-induced nuclear reaction cross section data are very important for the production of medical radioisotopes using cyclo- trons. The excitation functions of 203Tl(p,2n)202Pb, 205Tl(p,2n)204Pb, 203Tl(p,4n)200Pb, 203Tl(p,3n)201Pb, 205Tl(p,3n)203Pb, and 205Tl(p,4n)202Pb reactions have been reported in the literature [15–19].

The setup is shown in Fig. 2. 203Pb was detected by 279.2 and 401.3 keV lines in the γ-ray spectra of the samples. Only the more intense 279.2 keV line was used for the quantitative evalua- tion. Target dissolution. To separate 203Pb, the target (after irradiation) should be dissolved in an appropriate solvent. The target was eluted with 1 M HNO3, and natTl and 203Pb were collected in a beaker. This solution was stored and tagged with A. The target was irradiated for 30 min with 28.5 MeV protons at a beam current of 150 μA. The back of the Fig. 2. Target holder, beam current, and cooling water system (inlet and outlet). Beam line  with 25 ml of 30% HCl. The solution containing 203Pb was transferred onto the column. In the course of elu- tion, 203Pb is washed out from the column, and the other nuclides remain adsorbed. The collected solution was heated to remove HCl, and the residue was dis- solved in normal saline solution. Solvent extraction. Another part of B was dis- solved in 8 M HCl. Iron was extracted with diisopropyl ether (DIPE), the aqueous phase was heated to evapo- rate the HCl, and the residue was dissolved in normal saline (0.9% w/v NaCl). Solid phase extraction with nanomagnetic ion- imprinted polymer. The magnetic nanoparticles were prepared according to [20]. Briefly, to 20 mL of a 2 M FeCl3 solution in an Erlenmeyer flask, 13.3 mL of 1 M sodium sulfite was added dropwise under sonication over the course of 1 min. This solution was transferred to 250 mL of 0.85 M aqueous ammonia with vigorous stirring. The solution color turned from orange to black immediately. Then, 500 mL of deionized water was added to the mixture, and the mixture was heated at 90°C for 2 h with stirring in an air flow. To prepare Pb-imprinted amino-functionalized sor- bent based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), 1.5 g of Pb(NO3)2 was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol with stir- ring and heating, and 5 mL of 3-aminopropyltri- ethoxysilane (APS) was added to the mixture. The so- lution was stirred and refluxed for 2 h. After that, 10 mL of glycerol and 30 mL of deionized water were added. Then, a portion of the suspension of MNPs in water was added. After stirring for 24 h and at 90°C, the sorbent was collected with a power magnet. Amino-functionalized MNPs were washed four times, each time with 25 mL of ethanol and 25 mL of 0.02 M NaCl. Finally, the particles were dried under in a vac- uum at 70–80°C for 12 h. The γ-ray spectrum of the dissolved target is shown in Fig. 3. Radioisotopes of Tl and Pb are manifested in the spectrum. The γ-ray spectrum of the 203Pb solution is shown in Fig. 4. The 279.2 keV peak (fundamental γ-photon energy of 203Pb) is in the middle of the opti- mum range for detection with high efficiency. Samples for analysis of radionuclidic impurities were taken with a coring needle and analyzed by γ-ray spectros- copy. The radionuclidic purity of 203Pb exceeded 99.5%.  203Pb (279 keV) Fig. 3. γ-Ray spectrum of the dissolved target (EOB, before separation). After at least 37 h to ensure the decay of most of 201Pb (T1/2 = 9.33 h) to 201Tl, about 5 mg of FeCl3 was added to a part of the nitrate solution (solution A) for precipitating 203Pb. Then, the solution was alkalized to pH 12 with ammonium hydroxide. 203Pb is coprecipi- tated with ferric hydroxide. To separate trace amounts of thallium that can be adsorbed, the precipitate was dissolved in the same way, and washed with aqueous ammonia. Finally, excess ammonia was removed by heating. The residue was stored with tag B. Ion-exchange separation of 203Pb. An appro- priate amount of B was dissolved in 25 mL of HCl (30% w/v). A column (1 cm i.d.) was packed with AG-1×8 resin. The resin was pretreated by washing  203Pb (601 keV) 201Pb   203Pb (279 keV)    The total amount of 203Pb before and after separa- tion was determined in all cases by the region of inter- est (ROI) values. The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods. The irradiation yield is 2.2 mCi μA–1 h–1.      2. Nwe, K., Kim, Y.S., Milenic, D.E., et al., J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm., 2012, vol. 55, pp. 423–426. 3.
