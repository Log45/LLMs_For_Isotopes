Macroscopic amounts of the thorium bulk (20 g) were separated by its extraction by a solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions, with microamounts of 228Ra and 228Ac remaining in the aqueous phase. 228Ac was selectively extracted from the resulting solution by the method of extraction chromatography on a col- umn with RE resin sorbent, and 228Ra quantitatively remained in the 4 M HNO3 eluate. 228Ac was washed out of the column with 0.05 M HNO3, it could be used as a radioisotope for research purposes. After the accumulation of the daughter 228Ac the solution of 228Ra in 4 M HNO3 was repeatedly passed through an identical column. The resulting 228Ac was used in the study to examine its sorption on commercial and modiﬁ ed carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) instead of the diﬃ cultly accessible 225Ac. It is shown that the application of CNMs as carriers of actinium isotopes for nuclear medicine purposes is promising.    The targeted alpha-therapy in nuclear medicine frequently uses the 225Ac that undergoes the fast alpha- decays [1–3]. This isotope is obtained by diﬀ erent methods, including that in which thorium targets are irradiated with high-energy protons. However, this method does not ﬁ nd wide application because the number of suitable accelerators in the world is exceedingly small, which gives rise to problems with the availability of the given isotope [4]. In addition, 225Ac is not quite convenient for pre-clinical trials because of emitting gamma photons in low yield (not more tham 1% at 100 keV). At the same time, the gamma-emitting isotope 228Ac (T1/2 = 6.1 h) is present in the radioactive decay series of natural thorium as a product formed in the decay of a mother isotope 228Ra and can be isolated in the radiochemically pure form. To advantages of 228Ac, isolated from 228Ra belong the long lifetime of  the mother nuclide (T1/2 = 5.7 yrs) and the absence of long-lived daughter nuclide. The activity of 228Ra in the secular equilibrium with 232Th is about 1.6 kBq per gram of thorium nitrate. Therefore, with 228Ra isolated from gram amounts of thorium nitrate, 228Ac can be dayly extracted from the generator with activity suﬃ cient for carrying out studies, including those performed in vivo (several and tens of kBq). Various ways to separate Th, Ra, and Ac are known from the literature [4–10]. 228Ra and 232Th are, as a rule, separated via coprecipitation of radium and its extraction in various systems [4, 5]. Actinium and radium are separated by ion-exchange chromatography [6, 7], extraction [8], selective sorption [9], and extraction chromatography [4, 6,10]. In these studies, small amounts of 232Th or trace amounts of 229Th have been used. At the same time, there is no published information about isolation of 228Ac from large amounts of 232Th (tens of grams).    Studies concerned with the possibility of targeted delivery of actinium examined the sorption of 225Ac on various supports in radiopharmpreparations. For example, it has been shown that it is possible to use liposomal carriers [11–14] or nanoparticles based on inorganic substances: LaPO4 [15–19], InPO4 [20], GdVO4 [21], and TiO2 [22]. At the same time, application of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) seems to be promising because of the important properties: potential biocompatibility of their separate forms, accessibility in industrial amounts, low cost as compared with vector molecules, and the possibility of varying their biodistribution upon an appropriate modiﬁ cation. However, the evidence about using CNMs as actinium supports is extremely scarce [23, 24]. In this context, the goal of the present study was to develop a method for quantitative isolation of 228Ac as a product of 228Ra decay from natural thorium, with their subsequent separation and using the isolated 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state to examine the sorption of actinium on CNM sample with varied structure and physicochemical properties.  Development of a procedure for separation of radiochemically pure 228Ac from natural thorium. In the study, we used thorium nitrate (weighed portions with masses of up to 20 g) with decay products accumulated during 60 years. All the chemical reagents used in the study were not less than chemically pure.  The puriﬁ ed 228Ac preparation was obtained in several stages. In the ﬁ rst stage, macroamounts 232Th and accumulated 228Th are separated from a mixture of their decay products (Fig. 1) via extraction of thorium by a 1 : 1 solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions. The choce of the extraction agent was governed by earlier studies [4] in which it was found that the best reagent among those examined for separation of 232Th from products formed in its irradiation by high-energy protons (and also of radium and actinium) is HDEHP, which extracts 232Th from nitrate solutions in a wide range of HNO3 concentrations [25–27]. The phases were vigorously agitated for 5 min, centrifuged, and then separated in a separating funnel. The extraction was performed three times, and the aqueous solution with 228Ra was passed, to be fuller puriﬁ ed to remove thorium, through a column with extraction-chromatographic sorbent LN (Triskem Int., France, based on HDEHP, particles size 100–150 mesh). The sorbent ﬁ rmly retains thorium in a wide range of HNO3 concentrations, with radium and actinium not retained by this sorbent at HNO3 concentrations exceeding 0.2 M [28]. The mixture of nuclides, remaining after the separation of thorium isotopes contains 228Ra (in which 228Ac accumulates) and also 224Ra (in equilibrium with other decay products, including gaseous 220Rn) and the stable 208Pb. A single-stage isolation of 228Ac from a mixture of this kind is a complicated task, and deep puriﬁ cation to remove 224Ra is necessary for obtaining the radiochemically pure 228Ac. For this reason, the   mixture was kept for one month till the complete decay of 224Ra. In the ﬁ nal stage, 228Ac was separated from 228Ra, 208Pb, and newly formed 228Th. For this purpose, a solution of 228Ra in HNO3 was evaporated to dryness in a glass ﬂ ask on an electric hot plate, dissolved in 4 M HNO3; and the solution was placed in a column with RE extraction-chromatographic sorbent (Triskem Int., France, based on carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide and tributyl phosphate) with volume of 2 mL. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by selective elution from the column: ﬁ rst, 228Ra was eluted with a 4 M HNO3 solution, and then 228Ac, in 0.05 M HNO3, with fractions collected each having a volume of 1 mL The purity of 228Ac was determined by registering its gamma- spectrum during three days. To perform experiments on sorption of actinium on CNMs, the 228Ac eluate in 0.05 M HNO3 was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in several mL of a phosphate buﬀ ered saline (PBS) with pH 7. Gamma-spectrometry. The content of thorium, radium, and actinium, in the samples was found by the gamma-spectrometry on a spectrometer equipped with a GR 3818 high-purity germanium detector (Canberra Industries, United States). Thorium was identiﬁ ed by the gamma-peak of 228Th with energy of 84.4 keV. The content of 228Ra was determined by using the additionally introduced gamma-emitting 226Ra (186 keV, 3.6%) obtained via dissolution of 226RaBr2 in 0.01 M HCl. 228Ac was determined from the lines at 338 (11.3%) and 911 (25.8%) keV. Characterization of CNMs. We used in the study the following commercial samples of CNMs: powdered detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) of UDA-TAN brand (Federal State Unitary Enterprise SKTB Tekhnolog, Russia), aqueous suspension of partly reuced graphite oxide (GO), and powdered multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Nanotekhtsentr OOO, Tambov, Russia). The morphology of CNM particles was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on a JEM-2100F/Cs/GIF instrument (JEOL, Japan). The speciﬁ c surface of the CNMs was determined by the method of thermal desorption of nitrogen in terms of the BET model. The content of impurity elements in the CNMs was found by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP- MS) (X Series 2, Thermo Scientiﬁ c, United States). The elemental composition of the CNM surface was determined by the method of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical, Great Britain). The hydrodynamic diameter of CNM particles in hydrosols was determined by the method of dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Red Badge, 633 nm) ZEN 3600 analyzer (Malvern Instruments, United States). Acid functional groups on the CNM surface were determined by potentiometric titration. The surface of the CNM samples was modiﬁ ed by the procedures described in [29, 30]. DNDs were oxidized in a 3 : 1 mixture H2SO4/HNO3 at 120°C for 24 h, and GO and MWCNTs were hydrogenated in the Ar + 10% H2 atmosphere at 800°C for 5 h. Study of the sorption behavior of 228Ac on CNM. In a study of the sorption of Ac(III) on CNMs, a 100-μL portion of a CNM suspension was placed in polypropylene test tubes with a cover, and 900 μL of the resulting solution of 228Ac was added. The test tubes were shaken on a TS-100 shaker (Biosan, Latvia), and after that the mixture was centrifuged on a CM-50 centrifuge (Eppendorf, United States) for 20 min at 18000 g. Then, the gamma-spectrum of the 228Ac solution was recorded, and the counting rate of an aliquot of the solution was compared with that for a reference sample. To determine the amount of desorption, to the solution and precipitate remaining in the test tube was added a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, with the content of BSA in the resulting solution being 40 g/L. The contents of the test tube were stirred up and placed on a shaker, after which the phases were separated by centrifuging for subsequent radiometric measurements.  Development of a procedure for separation of radiochemically pure 228Ac from natural thorium. It was shown that 228,232Th is extracted with HDEHP from a 4 M HNO3 solution nearly quantitatively (99%), with no 228Ra extracted in this case. An additional puriﬁ cation of 228Ra remaining in the aqueous phase to remove thorium was performed by its passing through a column with extraction-chromatographic sorbent LN, with 99.9% 228Ra and not more than 0.01% 228,232Th contained in the eluate. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by the extraction-chromatographic method on the RE sorbent. It can be seen in Fig. 2, which shows a chromatogram, that 228Ra is quantitatively extracted in 2–5-mL fractions and 228Ac in 13–16-mL fractions. The ﬂ ow rate of the eluate was 1 mL/min, which makes it possible to separate 228Ra and 228Ac in 20 min. It was   10 20 30 40 50 60  t (  t, min  )  0   Fig. 2.

Kinetics of Ac(III) sorption on CNM in PBS at 25°C, m/V ratio 100 μg/mL. found here that the yield of 228Ac is nearly quantitative (not less than 95% relative to the amount placed on the column), with the separation factor of 228Ra and 228Ac being 2.2 × 104. According to [31], 208Pb is eluted from the column together with 228Ra. Thus, we developed a method for separation 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state from large amounts of natural thorium. The isolated 228Ac can be used in scientiﬁ c studies, including in vivo experiments. It was found that, with the developed method implemented, the loss of 228Ra does not exceed 0.005% of the amount placed in the column. Therefore, the starting 228Ra preparation can be repeatedly used. For this purpose, the fractions from 1 to 9 mL were evaporated and again dissolved in 1 mL of 4 M HNO3. It was shown that the results are reproducible because 228Ac could be eluted from the generator we developed not less than 20 times. In a prolonged use of the solution of 228Ra, there occurs accumulation of 228Th occurs due to the decay of 228Ac, but 228Th is quantitatively sorbed on the column with RE in the process of separation of 228Ra and 228Ac [31]. It is supposed that the columns with the sorbent are intended for single use, and, therefore, 228Th does not contaminate the solution of 228Ac being prepared. In the many-years use of the generator, the extract of 232Th can be repeatedly used to extract 228Ra accumulated in it.   samples. The physicochemical properties of the commercial and modiﬁ ed CNM samples are presented in Table 1. It can be seen in the table that the CNMs used in the study signiﬁ cantly changed from each other both in structure  and in composition. For example, DNDs are constituted by spherical particles, GO, by planar nanoparticles, and CNTs have micrometer threadlike structure with a internal hollow. Also the CNT samples had diﬀ erent speciﬁ c surface areas which were 240, 700, and 160 m2/g for DNDs, GO, and CNTs, respectively. It was found that, among the CNMs under study, DNDs have the smallest amount of impurities (up to 1.4 mg/g). It was shown that modiﬁ cation of samples in their oxidation and hydrogenation led to a change in the surface composition of CNMs according to the results of XPS and potentiometric titration. For example, the oxidation of a DND sample resulted in that the number of carboxy groups became 3 times larger (from 330 to 990 μmol/g). Study of 228Ac sorption onto CNMs. The kinetics of 228Ac sorption on various CNM samples in PBS was examined (Fig. 3). It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the sorption equilibrium is reached in 30 min for all the CNM samples for all studied CNMs. The sorption in 60 min was nearly quantitative (not less than 95% for DND, GO, and CNT samples, the limiting amount of sorption being about 60% for all the CNM samples. It was found the decrease between the CNM mass and the solution volume from 100 to 10 μg/mL does not lead to a change in the amount of sorption. This will make it possible to substantially reduce the mass of the in vivo introduced conjugate Ac(III)@CNM. It was shown by a study of the desorption of 228Ac from samples of commercial CNMs in a solution of BSA in BP that up to 30–40% of actinium is desorbed in 30 min, after which the amount of desorption does not change signiﬁ cantly during 150 min (Fig. 4). At the  DN  DN-COOH  -COOH  GO  -  CNT  -  60  60  40  40  20  20  100  100  80  80  01  02  03  04  05  06  0     same time, it was found that the desorption of 228Ac from DND-COOH, GO-H, and CNT-H samples under the same conditions does not exceed 5% in 3 h. The change in the behavior of Ac(III) in its sorption from PBS and desorption from BSA in PBS for the commercial DNDs, GO, and CNT and modiﬁ ed DND-COOH, GO-H ,and CNT-H can be accounted for by various factors. The sorption of Ac(III) on a commercial sample of DNDs probably occurs by two mechanisms: ﬁ rm chemical binding of 228Ac with carboxy groups and physical adsorption onto other groups on the DND surface. In the case of DND oxidation to DND-COOH, these groups are substituted by carboxy groups, which negatively aﬀ ects the total amount of adsorption because of the Fig. 4.

Interpretation of changes of this kind is diﬃ cult for GO and GO-H, and a further study of the 228Ac sorption mechanism on these samples is necessary. As for the interaction of 228Ac with CNTs, two mechanisms are probably operative in the sorption: sorption of ions within the tube hollows, as shown previously in [32], and the physical sorption on impurity metals (Table 1) contained at tube ends. In the hydrogenation, of CNTs, the catalyst is removed, which can account for the decrease in the total amount of sorption and the increase in the stability against desorption. To conclude, it can be noted that all the CNMs are promising for application in nuclear medicine as a carrier for actinium. In the case of limited amounts of radioactive isotopes of actinium, it is appropriate to use DNDs, GO, and CNTs for which the sorption is nearly quantitative, whereas DND-COOH, GO-H, and CNT-H are the most suitable for in vivo studies, For these the amount of desorption in 3 h does not exceed 5% in solutions of a model biological medium, whereas for the commercial CNMs under study it is about of 40%.       1.
