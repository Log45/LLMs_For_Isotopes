Cadmium-109 is used for fabricating reference ion- izing radiation sources. It can be produced by neutron irradiation of silver. In irradiation of the starting material with >98% enrichment for 6 months in the SM reactor with ther- mal neutrons at a flux density of 1 × 1015 n cm–2 s–1, the total yield of all the Cd isotopes is about 50% rela- tive to the initial silver weight; the specific activity of 109Cd is 4–4.2 Ci g–1. The production of the desired radionuclide is accompanied by the production of a significant amount of 110mAg. The subsequent radio- chemical processing of the irradiated sample is per- formed to remove 110mAg from 109Cd, obtain the re- quired chemical form of the product, and regenerate expensive 107Ag for the repeated irradiation. The 110mAg/109Cd activity ratio in the final product should not exceed 3 × 10–4%. Extensive experimental data are available on the separation of Ag and Cd by ion exchange, extraction, and selective precipitation of Ag [1, 2]. The over- whelming majority of methods are methods of analyti- cal chemistry, unsuitable for operation with gram amounts of Ag and Cd in hot cells under the conditions of remote control. Only the precipitation methods based on precipitation of poorly soluble silver halides or of Ag metal after the silver reduction are an excep- tion. We believe that the precipitation of Ag metal, which is a compact readily settling powder that can be readily washed, is the easiest in implementation. This method was used for isolation and purification of 109Cd [3]; silver was precipitated from 0.1–2 M HNO3 in the presence of NaNO3 on SKN carbon sorbent. At equal initial activity of 109Cd and 110mAg, the Cd/Ag separa- tion factor was approximately 500–800. Final purifica- tion of Cd to remove Ag was performed by isotope dilution of Ag, followed by the AgCl precipitation. In contrast to [3], in numerous procedures for re- covering Ag from wastes the reduction, as a rule, is performed in weakly alkaline or ammonia solutions, because specifically in these media it is most complete [4]. This study was aimed at developing a procedure for Cd purification to remove Ag in one process cycle by reduction and precipitation of Ag from ammonia solutions, followed by the Cd concentration in the form convenient for the subsequent preparation of the 109Cd product (hydrochloric acid solution with preset HCl concentration). We chose as reductant hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS), which does not react with Cd. The precipitated Ag metal is the ready starting product for fabricating targets. Then, Cd is precipitated from the mother liquor in the form of basic cadmium carbonate, which is then readily dissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this study, we determined the conditions for the most complete reduction of Ag and precipitation of basic cadmium carbonate from ammonia solutions.  We used for the experiments solutions of silver and cadmium nitrates labeled with 110mAg and 109Cd, re- spectively. For the experiments on the Ag reduction, the mixture of the solutions was evaporated to wet salts and dissolved in an ammonia buffer solution of    (the nuclide was not detected), we estimated the detec- tion limit corresponding to the minimum detectable activity.  Influence of the HAS/Ag Molar Ratio on the Completeness of the Ag Reduction The Ag ions are reduced with HAS in an ammonia solution, presumably, in accordance with the following equation 2Ag+ + 2NH4OH + (NH2OH)2·H2SO4 = 2Ag + N2 + 2H2O + (NH4)2SO4 + 2H+ (1)  As seen from Eq. (1), the Ag and HAS ions react in the 2 : 1 molar ratio. For the successful removal of Ag from Cd, it is important to know at what excess of HAS the residual concentration of Ag in the mother liquor will be the lowest. Figure 1 shows the results of experiments on the influence of the HAS/Ag molar ratio on the degree of reduction (precipitation) of Ag in an ammonia buffer solution at рН 10. As seen from Fig. 1, at HAS/Ag = 0.5, i.e., at a stoichiometric amount of HAS, 0.014% of Ag remains in the mother liquor, which corresponds to a decrease in the Ag concentration by a factor of 7.1 × 103. At HAS/Ag ≥ 1, the Ag concentration decreases by a factor of 1 × 105. Influence of рН on the Completeness of the Ag Reduction Because the Ag reduction is performed in an am- monia solution, Ag and Cd occur in the form of am- mine complexes. Therefore, it is hardly probable that an increase in the ammonia concentration and hence in pH will influence the completeness of the Ag reduc- tion. On the other hand, determination of the lower pH limit is very important for performing the process effi- ciently. HAS contains 1 mol of sulfuric acid per mole of the salt. According to Eq. (1), the Ag reduction is accom- panied by the formation of 2 mol of hydrogen ions from 1 mol of HAS. Apparently, the buffer capacity of the initial ammonia solution should exceed the sum of the concentrations of hydrogen ions released in the reaction of silver with HAS and introduced with HAS.

A preset amount of HAS was added to the solution, and the solution was mixed and allowed to stand for 24 h. The mother liquor was separated from the Ag precipitate on a green ribbon paper filter, the precipitate was washed with distilled water, and the wash waters were combined with the mother liquor. The precipitate was dissolved in 4 M HNO3. The content of Cd and Ag in the combined mother liquor and in the solution obtained after dis- solving the Ag precipitate was determined using radio- active tracers. To precipitate basic cadmium carbonate, moist cad- mium nitrate spiked with 109Cd was dissolved in an ammonia buffer solution of the preset composition. The mass concentration of Cd was 4–10 mg mL–1. To this solution, we added a K2CO3 solution to a concen- tration of 0.3 N, mixed, and allowed to stand for 4–6 h. The mother liquor was separated from the precipitate on a green ribbon filter, the precipitate was washed with distilled water, and the wash waters were com- bined with the mother liquor. The Cd content in the combined mother liquor and in the solution obtained after dissolving the precipitate of basic cadmium car- bonate was determined with the radioactive tracer. The activity of 109Cd and concomitant γ-emitting impurities (110mAg, 108mAg) was determined according to [5] on a γ-ray spectrometric installation with a DGDK-150V semiconductor germanium–lithium de- tector [6]. The activity of these radionuclides was de- termined from the results of measuring the counting rate (intensity) in the main peaks of total photon ab- sorption in the detector at the following energies, keV: 109Cd 88; 110mAg 657, 884, 937; 108mAg 434, 723. The relative uncertainty of the activity determination ranged from ±7 to ±20% depending on the peak inten- sity in accordance with [5]. In the case of no peaks    Fig. 2.

For the efficient separation of Ag and Cd, it is necessary to find conditions at which Cd would completely occur in the carbonate precipitate and Ag would occur in the solution the ammine complex. Apparently, the minimal concentration of ammonia should be sufficient for dissolving Ag and Cd nitrates with the formation of the corresponding soluble ammine complexes of Ag and Cd. The maximal concentration of ammonia should be so as to allow no less than 95% precipitation of cadmium carbonate.    the NH4OH– NH4NO3–K2CO3 system can be maintained not only by introducing the preset amount of NH4OH, but also by introducing the preset amount of NH4NO3. In this case, NH4OH is formed by the reaction       Fig. 3. Degree of precipitation of cadmium carbonate as a function of the NH4OH concentration at duifferent NH4NO3 concentrations. [NH4NO3], M: (1) 0, (2) 0.3, (3) 0.4, (4) 0.5, and (5) 0.6. Figure 2 shows how pH of the solution influences the degree of reduction (precipitation) of Ag in an am- monia buffer solution at the molar ratio HAS/Ag = 2. As seen from the above data, the best results are ob- tained when the HAS/Ag molar ratio is higher than unity and pH is higher than 6. Under these conditions, the weight fraction of Ag in the mother liquor does not exceed 0.014%.  Figure 3 shows the dependence of the degree of the CdCO3 precipitation on the NH4OH concentration at different NH4NO3 concentrations. The concentrations of potassium and cadmium carbonates in all the ex- periments were constant and equal to 0.3 and 0.1 M, respectively. As can be seen, at an NH4NO3 concentra- tion of 0–0.6 M the ammonia concentration should not exceed 0.8 M to ensure no less than 95% precipitation of Cd. Thus, the procedure described in this study allows efficient separation of 109Cd from 110mAg in one proc- ess cycle with quantitative isolation of purified 109Cd.     Cadmium and silver form poorly soluble carbonates and soluble ammonia complexes [4]. The solubility products of cadmium and silver carbonates are of the same order, about 5 × 10–12 and 8 × 10–12, respectively. The Ag ammine complexes are more stable than those of Cd by almost an order of magnitude. Apparently, the distirbution of Ag and Cd between the carbonate 1.
