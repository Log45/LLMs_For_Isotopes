Thorium foils were irradiated with 90-, 110-, and 135-MeV protons at the accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Troitsk (Moscow oblast). The cumulative production cross sections for 225Ac were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, and for 227Th (223Ra precursor), 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. Based on the experimental data and theoretical calculations, the possible yields of 225Ac and 223Ra in irradiation of thick thorium targets at various accelerators were deter- mined. An efficient procedure was suggested for isolating the products from the irradiated targets: 225Ac, by liquid extraction and extraction chromatography, and 223Ra, by sublimation from a thorium–lanthanum melt followed by thermochromatographic separation in metallic titanium columns and extraction-chromatographic isolation of radium. The procedure allows production of large (units of curies) amounts of radiochemically pure 225Ac and 223Ra, which is promising for wide use of these radionuclides in nuclear medicine.   Actinium-225 (T1/2 = 10.0 days) is one of the most promising α-emitting radionuclides for therapy of vari- ous tumor diseases [1, 2]. It is also promising to use this radionuclide in generators as a source of the daughter short-lived 213Bi (T1/2 = 46 min). Various methods for 225Ac production are known [3]. Usually this radionuclide is isolated from products of 233U decay following the scheme 233U (T1/2 = 1.6 × 105 years) → 229Th (T1/2 = 7340 years) → 225Ra (T1/2 = 14.8 days) → 225Ac [4, 5]. Difficult availability of the starting 233U restricts the possibility of producing large amounts of 225Ac. 229Th, from which 225Ac is di- rectly isolated, can also be produced from 230Th (T1/2 = 75 400 years) by irradiation with fast neutrons or γ-quanta [6]. The starting 230Th is a member of the 238U radioactive series, and its content is about 20 g per ton of uranium, i.e., this material is also difficultly avail- able.  targets by their irradiation with fast or thermal neu- trons [7, 8], γ-quanta [9], or accelerated protons or other charged particles [10, 11]. The starting 226Ra is also difficultly available. In addition, radium targets of relatively large mass are dangerous in handling, which gives rise to serious problems in their wide application, especially in cases when radium regeneration from the irradiated targets is required. Another radionuclide promising for medicine is 223Ra (T1/2 = 11.4 days). It is directly used for therapy of bone tumor diseases [12]. It can also serve as a source of 211Pb (T1/2 = 36 min) in generators [13]. The common route to small amounts of 223Ra is its isolation from 235U decay products. Large amounts of 223Ra can be produced by irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reac- tor, followed by chemical isolation of the formed 227Ac (T1/2 = 21.8 years) decaying into 227Th (T1/2 = 18.7 days) and then into 223Ra. As already noted, irra- diation and processing of a radium target involve seri- ous problems.        Fig. 1. Scheme of 225Ac isolation from irradiated thorium target. We believe that the most promising route of pro- duction of 225Ac, 223Ra, and some other important ra- dionuclides is irradiation of natural 232Th targets with medium-energy protons, followed by product isolation. In the early 1960s, Lefort et al. experimentally meas- ured the production cross sections of 225Ac and 223Ra from 232Th at a proton energy of 150 MeV [14], and Gauvin measured the 225Ac production cross sections at proton energies in the range 43–115 MeV [15]. Also, 232Th was irradiated with the aim of 225Ac pro- duction with 660-MeV protons at an accelerator in Dubna [16] and with 600-MeV protons at an accelera- tor in CERN [17]. The possibility of producing 225Ac from thorium by its irradiation with protons of the en- ergy lower than 40 MeV was noted recently [18], but no experimental data confirming this assumption were presented. On the whole, only limited information is available on optimization of production of various ra- dionuclides from a thorium target and on radiochemi- cal procedures for isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from irradiated Th and on their purification to remove other radionuclides. Up to now, 225Ac and 223Ra were not actually produced by this procedure. The major goal of this study was measuring the 225Ac and 223Ra production cross sections in reactions of Th with 90–135-MeV protons with the aim to opti- mize the conditions for production of large amounts of these radionuclides on the proton beam of the Moscow Meson Factory [Institute for Nuclear Research (INR), Russian Academy of Sciences, Troitsk]. In the course of our study, we developed efficient radiochemical procedures for isolating Ac and Ra in the radiochemi- cally pure state. It can be expected that wide use of 225Ac and 223Ra in medicine will allow in the future cardinal solution of the problem of treating many tu- mor diseases. Th irradiation. In irradiation experiments we used 10 × 10 mm2 pieces of 5-μm-thick Th metal foil. The foils were irradiated with a beam of accelerated pro- tons of energy 128, 143, and 158 MeV at the linear accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Rus- sian Academy of Sciences [19], at a beam current of approximately 5 μA. In the course of irradiation, tho- rium foils wrapped in aluminum foil were intensely cooled with a water flow. To decrease the proton en- ergy to 90, 110, and 135 MeV, graphite absorbers were arranged before the target. The accuracy in the proton energy determination was approximately ±2.5 MeV. The uncertainty was determined by the accelerator pa- rameters and by proton scattering as a result of their absorption by graphite and cooling water. The proton flux was monitored with Al and Cu foils by production of 22Na and 62Zn, respectively, whose production cross sections are known [20]. The foils after irradiation were withdrawn and sub- jected to γ-ray spectrometric analysis using a spec- trometer equipped with a HPGe detector with a beryl- lium window (Canberra GR 3818). 225Ac isolation. Actinium was isolated by the scheme shown in Fig. 1. The procedure consisted of the steps of liquid extraction and extraction chroma-  Irradiated metallic Th target Dissolution in conc.

Irradiated Th metal foils were dissolved in concentrated HNO3, the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 3–8 M HNO3, and Th was extracted with two portions of 1–5 M TBP or 0.1–0.5 M TOPO solution in toluene [21]. After the Th extraction, the aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, concentrated HClO4 was added, and the solu- tion was evaporated to dryness to remove Ru isotopes. For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatogra- phy in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-di- (TRU- isobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) [11, 22]. After washing the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, Ac was eluted with the next 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, and the solu- tion was collected. For complete purification of Ac, the extraction chromatography was performed twice. The radiochemical purity of 225Ac was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry with a semiconductor PIPS detector (Canberra). 223Ra isolation. Chemical isolation of Ra from irra- diated metallic Th was performed by a gas-chemical method. For this purpose, a piece of irradiated thorium foil (3 mg) together with metallic La (280 mg) was placed in a crucible of metallic Zr. Addition of La (Тm = 918°С) leads to formation of a melt with Th (for Th, Тm = 1755°С), and in the liquid metal diffusion and, correspondingly, release of the sublimed micro- elements are considerably faster than in solid Th. The crucible was heated for 1 h in succession at 970, 1040, 1130, 1190, 1270°С in a stream of helium purified with a titanium getter (the heating temperature was determined with an accuracy of ±15°С). Radium and other radionuclides were deposited at the furnace out- let on tantalum collectors in the form of foils which were replaced when changing the heating temperature. In another experiment (Fig. 2), an irradiated tho- rium sample with metallic La was heated for 1 h at 1200 ± 15°С, and the released products were trans- ferred with a helium stream into a thermochroma- tographic column (quartz tube lined with titanium foil from the inside); the sublimed elements were deposited on the Ti surface in different temperature zones. After the heating completion, the titanium foil serving as collector for sublimed products was cut into pieces (corresponding to temperature zones), and the γ-ray spectrum of each piece of the collector was measured. After that, the piece of the collector with the deposited Ra, Ba, and Sr was subjected to further purification by  Fig. 2. Installation for gas-chemical isolation of Ra: (1) ir- radiated Th in melt with metallic La in zirconium crucible, (2) quartz tube lined with niobium, (3) tubular resistance furnaces, (4) titanium getter for purification of helium be- ing fed, (5) Pt/RtRh thermocouple, and (6) titanium foil serving as collector for Ra and other sublimed products. extraction chromatography. The elements were washed off from the surface of the titanium foil-collector with 7 M HNO3, and the resulting solutions were passed through an extraction-chromatographic column packed with the sorbent containing 4,4'(5')-di-tert-butylcyclo- hexano-18-crown-6 (Sr-resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.). Radium was eluted with a 7 M HNO3 solution. Under these conditions, Ra is washed out, whereas Ba and Sr remain on the column. The radiochemical purity of 223Ra was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry. To prepare specimens for α-ray spectrometry, a known aliquot of the solution was applied dropwise onto stainless steel disks. By this procedure, we prepared radiochemically pure Ac and Ra samples. Figure 3 shows the γ-ray spectra of the irradiated thorium target and of chemi- cally isolated Ac and Ra fractions.  225Ac production cross sections and yields. In proton irradiation of Th, 225Ac is produced along sev- eral pathways. According to theoretical calculations, reaction the major pathways are 232Th(p,p7n)225Th followed by β+-decay into 225Ac with 10% probability and direct production by the reaction     Table 1. Contribution of various nuclear reactions (%) to the 225Ac yield in irradiation of Th with protons of various energies (calculation by ALICE-IPPE model, irradiation for 6 ч, cooling for 15 days) Proton energy, MeV 90 110 135  0.8 0.4 0.2 52.7 25.5 13.1 45.8 73.8 86.5 0.7 0.3 0.2 232Th(p,2p6n)225Ac (Table 1). Thus, the experimentally measured production cross sections are cumulative, and they cannot be accurate, because the production cross sections of the parent 225Th, 225Ra, 229Pa, and 225Ra were not determined sufficiently reliably. Never- theless, these cumulative cross sections allow estima- tion of 225Ac yields in irradiation of targets in different ranges of proton energy. The 225Ac production cross sections that we calcu- lated from γ-ray spectrometric data are plotted in Fig. 4 in comparison with the theoretical values obtained us- ing different models: ALICE (ALICE-IPPE version) and cascade evaporation (СЕF). For the proton ener- gies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, the experimental cross sections were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, respectively. Figure 4 also shows the experimental data obtained previously [14, 15]. Our experimental data lie between the theoretical data calculated by different models and better agree with the previous experimental data reported in [14], rather than in [15]. Figure 5 shows the 225Ac yields that we calculated for a thorium target in relation to its thickness and ini- tial (“inlet”) energy of protons incident on the thick target (the energy of protons leaving the target was taken equal to 40 MeV; below this energy, the 225Ac yield is extremely low). Figure 5 shows the experimen- tal yield curve plotted on the basis of compilation of our data with those reported in [14] (at relatively high energies) and [15] (at lower energies). The yield curve plotted on the basis of theoretical cross section calcula- tions (ALICE-IPPE model) is also given. The values from [15] are in poor agreement with the results of   Fig. 3. γ-Ray spectra: (a) irradiated thorium target (2 days after irradiation completion), (b) Ac fraction isolated from irradiated Th, and (c) Ra fraction isolated from irradiated Th.

As can be seen, it is more appropriate to produce 225Ac at proton energies exceeding 100 MeV. On the basis of the available experimental and theo- retical data (Table 2), we calculated the amounts of 225Ac that can be produced in one 10-day irradiation run at various accelerators: in INR, Brookhaven Na- tional Laboratory (USA), Los Alamos National Labo- ratory (USA), TRIUMF (Canada), and Arronax (France). The real beam current attainable at these in- stallations on thorium targets, taking into account the possibilities of their cooling, is given. The proton en- ergy decreases on passing through inlet windows, cool- ing water layer, and target shell, so the energy of pro- tons incident on the target (“inlet” energy) is usually lower by 5–15 MeV than the initial accelerated proton energy. Some installations use multilayer targets for better cooling, and certain energy loss is observed in water gaps between the target layers and in the shells (this loss was taken equal to 10%). The chemical yield was taken equal to 90%. The target was kept after irra- diation for 10 days in the case of 225Ac and 16 days in the case of 223Ra (the best time for accumulation from 227Th). As can be seen, the Ac yield monotonically in- creases with an increase in the proton energy, and effi- cient production is possible by irradiation of a metallic Th target with accelerated protons of the energy ex- ceeding 100 MeV. 227Th production cross sections and 223Ra yields. Theoretical calculations show that the major pathway of 223Ra formation is via α-decay of 227Th (Т1/2 = 18.7 days) produced by the (p,p5n) reaction and via  β+-decay of 227Pa produced by the (p,6n) reaction. The contributions of the direct 223Ra production and its pro- duction via 223Fr and 223Rn are insignificant (<1%). The experimental cumulative production cross- sections of 227Th, determined in this study for proton energies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, are 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. In Fig. 6, these data are given in comparison with the results of calculations by two versions of ALICE code and by the СЕF model. The theoretical and experimental values are in reason- able agreement. Figure 7 shows the calculated 223Ra yields in irra- diation of a thorium target (irradiation for 10 days, cooling for 16 days, an optimal dime for the decay of 227Th into 223Ra). The possibilities of 223Ra produc- tion at various existing accelerators are compared in Fig. 5.

Table 2. It is appropriate to produce 223Ra, like 225Ac, at accelerators with the energy exceeding 100 MeV and high beam current. Chemical isolation of Ac. The γ-ray spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of more than 80 radio- active isotopes of various elements in products of Th irradiation. Along with the desired 225Ac and 223Ra, other radionuclides are formed by fusion and spallation reactions and by the subsequent decay of the products of these reactions: 224Ra (Т1/2 = 3.7 days), 225Ra (14.8 days), 226Ac (29 h), 227Ac (21.8 years), 227Th (18.7 days), 228Th (1.9 years), 231Th (25.5 h), 228Pa (22 h), 229Pa (1.4 days), 230Pa (17.4 days), 232Pa (1.3 days), 233Pa (27 days), and 230U (20.8 days). It is important that irradiation of metallic Th is not ac- companied by formation of significant amounts of 222Rn (3.8 days), giving rise to serious technical prob- lems in the isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from radium sources. Also, some fission products were detected in amounts comparable (in activity) with those of the de- Fig. 8.

The relative activity of 225Ac in the mixture formed was as low as ~1%, and that of 223Ra, several percents. Thus, isolation of radiochemically pure 225Ac from a complex mixture of radionuclides is a complex prob- lem. The process for 225Ac isolation from solution con- sisted of extraction and extraction-chromatographic steps. In liquid extraction, macroamounts of Th, and also Pa, Zr (>90%), I (>75%), and Nb (35–40%) pass to the organic phase, whereas the other elements, in- cluding Ac and Ra, remain in the aqueous phase. The results of extraction-chromatographic separa- tion of a number of elements in the carrier-free state are shown in Fig. 8. Washing of the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3 eliminates such interfering radionuclides as 136Cs, 105Ru, 140Ba, and 131I. The Ac fraction was eluted in the next 15 ml of the acid, whereas such in- terfering radionuclides as 141Ce and 140La remained on the column. We found that 225Ac was fully purified when the extraction chromatography was performed twice. Figure 3b shows the γ-ray spectrum of the iso- lated Ac fraction. The purity of the product obtained by irradiation of Th with 110-MeV protons and puri- fied using the above-described chemical procedure is characterized by the following parameters: chemical yield of 225Ac no less than 90%; radionuclidic purity of     the product (18 days after irradiation completion), de- termined by α- and γ-ray spectrometry: 226Ac (Т1/2 = 29 h) 0.1%, 227Ac (Т1/2 = 21.8 years) ≤0.1%, other ra- dionuclides <0.1%. Chemical isolation of Ra. Radium-223 was iso- lated by a gas-chemical method used previously for isolating certain actinide, lanthanide, and alkaline- earth elements in the carrier-free form [23, 24]. The method is based on the fact that Ra in the metallic state is considerably more volatile than Th and a number of other interfering elements (Ac, Pa, La, Pm, Ce, Nd, Be, Cr, Zr, Mo, Nb, Tc, Sn, Ag, Ru, Rh). The addition of metallic La is extremely important. Thorium placed in a zirconium crucible together with metallic La dis- solved in liquid La in the course of heating, which en- sured fast diffusion of the microelements being iso- lated in the liquid metal and high degree of sublima- tion of Ra isotopes. The presence of metallic La also stabilizes the metallic state of nonvolatile elements (actinides, lanthanides, and also Sn) which could sub- lime at the experiment temperature in the form of vola- tile lower oxides from vessels made of Ti and Zr [25]. Lanthanum also binds into nonvolatile compounds Sb and Te, which under other conditions readily sublime at approximately 1200°С [26]. Special experiments showed that without metallic La the Ra sublimation yield decreased and some other interfering elements sublime, which makes the subsequent thermochroma- tographic separation less efficient. Heating of the irradiated metallic Th in the pres- ence of La for 2 h at 1200°С ensured release of more than 99% of radium isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, 225Ra), of Sr and Ba isotopes, and also of I, Br, Cd, and Cs, which are highly volatile in the elementary state. The ele- ments that exhibit low volatility in the elementary state (Ac, Th, Pa, U, Ru, Sn, Zr, Nb, Y, Mo, Ce, Pm, Nd), and also Sb and Te did not sublime and fully remained in the crucible. Figure 9 shows the temperature de- pendence of the release of various elements from a melt with La (the points characterize stepwise heating of the same sample at successively increasing tempera- tures, for 1 h at each temperature). The relatively low degree of the release of I can be accounted for by low rate of diffusion of large iodide ion in a Th–La melt. Figure 10 shows the distribution of the isolated ele- ments in the titanium thermochromatographic column. The deposition temperature of Ra, Ba, and Sr (maxi- mum of the thermochromatographic peak) under these conditions was 800 ± 30; that of Be, ≥1170; that of  Fig. 9.

Other elements: Th, Ac, Pa, La, Pm, Ce, Nd, Cr, Zr, Mo, Nb, Tc, Te, Sn, and Sb. Cs, I, and Br, 350 ± 50; and that of Cd, 220 ± 30°С. Apparently, Ra, Ba, Sr, Be, Cs, and Cd are transported along the thermochromatographic column in the ele- mentary state, whereas I and Br form compounds with Ti. As can be seen, by depositing the sublimed ele- ments on the Ti collector in the temperature range 1100–600°С (the range is refined depending on the isolation conditions), it is possible to obtain a fraction of Ra containing only Ва and Sr impurities. The subsequent extraction-chromatographic purifi- cation of this fraction allows us to obtain a fraction of pure Ra containing 223Ra with impurities of 225Ra and 224Ra (Fig. 3c). Thus, we have developed an efficient procedure for isolating 225Ac and 223Ra from metallic Th irradiated with medium-energy accelerated protons. The proce- dure involves liquid extraction and extraction chroma-    tography for the isolation of 225Ac and gas-chemical isolation and extraction chromatography for 223Ra. The results obtained are the basis for a process [27] for pro- duction of large amounts (several curies) of 225Ac and 223Ra by isolation from thick metallic Th targets irradi- ated on a high-flux proton beam, which is important for wide use in nuclear medicine.  12.
