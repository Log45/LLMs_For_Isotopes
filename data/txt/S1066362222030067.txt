Using the equilibrium shift method, it was shown that ytterbium and lutetium are recovered by the cation exchange mechanism in the form of the Ln[HA2]3 adduct up to 3 M HNO3, and with a further increase in the concentration of nitric acid in an aqueous solution, the separation mechanism changes to a solvate one. The separation factors β(Lu/Yb) in the studied separation systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained data can be used for subsequent calculations of the extraction cascade for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium. Mathematical processing of experimental data was carried out to derive separation constants. Keywords: lutetium, ytterbium, liquid extraction, 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester, bis(2,4,4- trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid, extraction separation, mathematical modeling DOI: 10.1134/S1066362222030067  Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a therapeutic radioisotope, which is widely used for medical purposes due to optimal nuclear-physical parameters: a convenient half- life (T1/2 = 6.7 days); acceptable energy of β-particles (maximum energy 0.5 MeV), which allows destroying small tumors and metastases 1–3 mm in size without aﬀ ecting healthy tissues; soft γ-radiation emission with energy suﬃ cient to visualize and track drug migration in the patient’s body (Eγ = 113 keV (6.4%) and 208 keV (11%)) [1, 2]. The decay product of 177Lu is the stable isotope 177Hf. In addition, 177Lu has chemical properties suitable for protein labeling (e.g., dotatate peptide [3]) with bifunctional chelating agents [4]. The main method for producing a high speciﬁ c activity 177Lu preparation is neutron irradiation of the starting material containing 176Yb [5]. Irradiation of an ytterbium target highly enriched in the 176 isotope is advantageous since in this case, due to the β–decay of the 177Yb, a monoisotopic product, 177Lu, is formed. Thus, the problem of obtaining an isotopically pure target product is reduced to its separation from the target material by chemical methods. The separation of Lu from Yb is a diﬃ cult task, since both elements are lanthanides and are similar in their physicochemical properties. Therewith, even a small amount of impurities of stable isotopes of lutetium at a level of several tenths of a mass fraction can lead to a signiﬁ cant decrease in the speciﬁ c activity of 177Lu. Taking into account the rather short half-life of 177Lu, the separation should be carried out using highly selective methods: extraction or chromatography [6]. Chromatographic separation is usually employed to produce chemically pure individual elements, but such a process is unproductive: concentration to prepare fractions up to 1 g/L is diﬃ cult to enhance productivity [7].    The problems of separating elements with similar chemical properties are also solved by the extraction method, in particular, when separating REE and transplutonium elements. In industry, organophosphorus (2-ethhexylphosphonic acid acids such as P507 mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) [8], Cyanex 272 (bis(2,4,4- trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid) INET-3 (2,3-dimethylbutyl)(2,4,4ꞌ-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid [11], HDEHP (di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid) [12] have recently been utilized for these purposes. It is also known that the separation of Yb/Lu by blends of extractants Cyanex 272, P507, and HDEHP exhibits a synergistic eﬀ ect [9, 13].  2-Ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) is a promising extractant in the REE production, since systems based thereof have higher separation factors of lanthanides [14]. The task of the extraction method is to separate 177Lu as fast as possible because of the short half-life, from the main mass of ytterbium, ensuring the most convenient subsequent handling of the recovered lutetium. This work is aimed at assessing the possibility of using the organophosphorus extractants Р507 and Cyanex-272 for the separation of pure lutetium.  Nitric acid and ytterbium and lutetium oxides of chemically pure grade, 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) manufactured by Luoyang Zhongda Chemical Co. with a purity of at least 99%, bis-(2,4,4- trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) from Cytec Solvay Group (content of the main substance 90.6%), isopar-M (Exxon Mobil), and m-nitrobenzotriﬂ uoride (F3) with a chemical purity of 99% were employed in the study. The solution was evaporated to dryness. After cooling, the resulting mixed salt was dissolved in 1 M HNO3, transferred into a 25-mL volumetric ﬂ ask, and made up to the mark with distilled water. As a result, standard solutions of 20 g/L Lu and 200 g/L Yb were obtained. Working solutions were prepared by diluting the standard. Working concentrations varied from 0.05 to 200 g/L. The concentrations of standard solutions were monitored by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ISP-OES) on a Prodigy Plus spectrometer. The following characteristic wavelengths of radiation of Yb and Lu atoms were chosen: ytterbium,  289.138 and 369.419 nm; lutetium, 291.139 and 302.054 nm. Extraction tests were carried out in test tubes with a volume of 15 mL. The phases were in contact for 5 min. Reextraction of Lu and Yb from the organic phase was carried out with 5 M HNO3 solutions. Before taking the back extract for analysis, the samples were centrifuged to completely separate the aqueous and organic phases. Then the concentrations of ytterbium and lutetium in the back extracts were determined. Solutions of Yb and Lu metals were prepared according to the standard procedure: metal oxides (99.99%) weighed on a Mettler Toledo ML303T/A00 analytical balance (accuracy class II), were dissolved in concentrated 8 M nitric acid at heating without boiling. The solution was evaporated to dryness. After cooling, the resulting mixed salt was dissolved in 1 M HNO3, transferred into a 25-mL volumetric ﬂ ask, and made up to the mark with distilled water. As a result, standard solutions of 20 g/L Lu and 200 g/L Yb were prepared. Working solutions were produced by diluting the standard. Working concentrations varied from 0.05 to 200 g/L. The concentrations of standard solutions were monitored by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ISP-OES) on a Prodigy Plus spectrometer. The following characteristic wavelengths of radiation of Yb and Lu atoms were chosen: ytterbium 289.138 and 369.419 nm; lutetium 291.139 and 302.054 nm. Extraction tests were carried out in 15 mL test tubes with a volume. The phases were in contact for 5 min. Reextraction of Lu and Yb from the organic phase was carried out with 5 M HNO3 solutions. Before taking the back extract for analysis, the samples were centrifuged to completely separate the aqueous and organic phases. Then the ytterbium and lutetium concentrations in the back extracts were determined.  The separation of REE from nitric acid media with solutions of organophosphorus acids can be represented as the reaction equation  – (aq) + nNO3 = [Ln(NO3)nA3–n(HA)(2m+n–3)](o) + (3–n)H+       Fig. 1.

(Point) experiment, (line) calculation. acid molecule. Most authors believe that the extractant is present in the organic phase as a dimer (HA)2 [15], since the dimerization constants of P507 and Cyanex-272 are very high (log K = 20 and 4.2, respectively [16]). In the separation of rare earth elements with P507 solutions in the range of HNO3 concentrations not higher than 4 M, a linear relationship between the logarithms of Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients and the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration is observed with a slope close to –3 (Fig. 1), which allows the reaction equation to be applied: The deviation from the linearity (Fig. 1) at a concentration of 4 M HNO3 and higher may be due to the transition to extraction by the solvate (donor- acceptor) mechanism, which occurs, for example, in the extraction of REE with HDEHP solutions from acidic media [17, 18]. It is assumed that from 1 to 3 extractant molecules take part in the formation of the solvate [19], however, in view of the insigniﬁ cance of this reaction contribution to the overall extraction mechanism and the lack of data at higher HNO3 concentrations, the value of m was taken equal to 1, as in [4].             Ln(HA ) 2 3   + 3 [H ]     [Ln ] (HA )  2      In this case, the distribution coeﬃ cient should be inversely proportional to the concentration of the proton in the cube and directly proportional to the concentration of the dimer of the extractant, also to the third power:   – (aq) +3NO3   Thus, the deviation from the linear relationship between the REE distribution coeﬃ cients and the HNO3 concentration in logarithmic coordinates in the region of its high concentrations (above 3 M) can be described using the equilibrium constant:   H [Ln(HA ) A ] 2       3+ [Ln ] NO       3    (HA ) 2 3     The high values of the ytterbium and lutetium distribution coeﬃ cients during extraction with P507 solutions in isopar M complicate the REE re-extraction, which brings about the need to use solutions with a high HNO3 concentration at this stage of the process and     phase and to Eq. (2), as well as indirectly conﬁ rms the participation of P507 dimer molecules in the formation of compounds with REE. It is known that the use of heavy ﬂ uorinated diluents, for example, F3, also leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients; therefore, it was of interest to study the eﬀ ect of this diluent on the REE extraction with P507 solutions. The nature of the relationship between the REE distribution coeﬃ cients and the HNO3 concentration in the extraction of Yb and Lu with P507 solutions in F3 does not depend on the nature of the diluent (Fig. 3), however, the inﬂ uence of the solvation mechanism starts to manifest itself somewhat earlier (from 3 M HNO3) than in the case of extraction with Р507 solutions in isopar M. The curve of the distribution coeﬃ cients of ytterbi- um and lutetium vs. the P507 concentration in isopar-M constructed in logarithmic coordinates (Fig. 4) have a linear form with a slope close to 2, and not to 3, which may be a consequence of an increase in the degree of association of extractant molecules with a growth in its concentration. This fact leads to a decrease in the REE extraction constants with a rise in the P507 concentra- tion (Table 1). The concentration equilibrium constants of Eq. (5) turned out to be the same for isopar M and F3, therewith for lutetium they turned out to be lower than for ytterbium.  Fig. 2. Extraction isotherm of Yb in 15% Р507 solutions and Cyanex-272 in isopar М from 1 M HNO3. complicates further handling of the products. Reduction of the P507 concentration can be considered as an alternative variant, however, it leads to a decrease in the productivity of the process, since the saturation of the extractant decreases. At a P507 concentration of 15% (0.45 M), the maximum saturation of the extract with ytterbium tends to 0.075 M (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the molar ratio of REE : P507 = 1 : 6 in the organic     Fig. 3.

Similar relationships were used in [14], where the eﬀ ect of the P507 concentration on the logarithms of the REE extraction constants from chloride media was described by the BCHA  Figure 5 shows the linear relationship between the logarithms of the equilibrium constants (2) and (5) and the logarithm of the relative Р507 concentration. The values of the slope coeﬃ cients a and the values of the parameters log K0 calculated by the least squares method are presented in Table 2. Unfortunately, the derived log K0 values were found to be diﬀ erent for these two diluents, which did not allow reducing the number of parameters used. The almost parallel behavior of the curves of the REE distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the P507 concentration and the HNO3 concentration indicates that the separation factors of Yb and Lu will slightly rise with a decrease in the extractant concentration remaining in the range of 1.4–1.6 (the separation factors were derived as the ratio of the experimentally found distribution coeﬃ cients from solutions containing Yb and Lu in diﬀ erent proportions). With an increase in the HNO3 concentration in an aqueous solution, the solvate mechanism of REE extraction begins to play an increasingly important role resulting in a decrease in separation factors.

Eﬀ ect of Cyanex-272 concentration in isopar M on the distribution coeﬃ cients of (a) Yb and (b) Lu during their extraction from HNO3 solutions of various concentrations (initial REE concentration 0.2–0.4 g/L. (Points) experiment; (lines) calculation.     It is known that the use of bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) as an extractant instead of P507 leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients by approximately 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining high values of the separation factors [20, 21]. Therefore, it was of interest to study the regularities of Yb and Lu extraction with solutions of Cyanex-272 in isopar M. In contrast to the system with P507, the functions of the logarithms of the Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration at a concentration of less than 1 M in this system have a slope of about –2.5 (Fig. 6), which results in the need to apply for simulation of the REE extraction in this region not only Eq. (2), but also Eq. (8) derived from Eq. (1) at m = 2 and n = 1:  – (aq) + NO3 (aq) + 2(HA)2(o) = H2[Ln(NO3)A4](o) + 2H+  With increasing the acid concentration in the aqueous phase above 3 M, the REE extraction brings about an increase in the distribution coeﬃ cients, which can be due to a gradual transition to the solvate mechanism of extraction. At the same time, with an increase in the concentration of Cyanex-272, the slope of the ascending section of the function of the distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the HNO3 concentration diminishes (Fig. 6), which can be described by Eqs. (5) and (9) derived from Eq. (1) at m = 1 and n = 2:  – (aq) + 2 NO3    The slope of the function of REE distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the Cyanex-272 concentration in isopar M at 1 and 3 M HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 7) is close to 1.6, which corresponds to the cumulative proceeding of reactions (2), (5), (8), and (9). The slope coeﬃ cients a and the parameters log K0 of Eq. (7) presented in Table 1 evidence that the values of the parameters a of Eq. (7) practically do not diﬀ er for Yb and Lu, which notices that the separation factors of these elements are independent of the extractant concentration. The equilibrium constants of Eqs. (5) and (9) for Yb and Lu coincide and practically do not depend on the extractant concentration, which conﬁ rms the decrease in the separation factors of these elements at HNO3 concentrations above 2 M. At a lower concentration, the separation factors of the Yb/Lu pair increase and reach 1.4–1.6, which makes it possible to consider this extractant as an alternative to P507. At the same time, the low saturation of Cyanex-272 (Fig. 2) necessitates the use of Cyanex-272 only in a mixture with other extractants. The average error in calculating the distribution coeﬃ cients according to the model does not exceed 7–8 rel %.     Extraction systems for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium based on acidic organophosphorus extractants P507 and Cyanex-272 from nitric acid solutions have been studied. In the course of the experiments, results were found both with the use of a light diluent (Isopar M) and a heavy diluent F3. The separation factors of lutetium and ytterbium in the studied extraction systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained experimental data on the extraction of lutetium and ytterbium with P507 were used to construct a mathematical model that makes it possible to predict the behavior of Yb and Lu in the extraction cascade. A special report will be devoted to testing technological regimes for the lutetium and ytterbium separation.    1.
