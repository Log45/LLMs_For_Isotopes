Data on the nuclide composition and weight content of U, Pu, Am, Cm, Nd were obtained, the speciﬁ c activity of 14C, 3H, 106Ru, the weight content of Zr, Mo, Pd, Rh in solution and in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF were determined. The burn-up depth of MNUP fuel is calculated from the ratio of the number of ﬁ ssion product atoms, burn-up monitor, to the number of heavy atoms.

Appropriate experimental studies are required to substantiate the safe use of nitride fuel, verify calculation codes, establish a balance of ﬁ ssile materials and ﬁ ssion products, and accumulate potentially radiation-hazardous nuclides.  the MNUP SNF composition are limited. The literature reports radiochemical analysis data on MNUP fuel irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor [2]. In [2] the isotopic composition and weight content of U, Pu, Ce, Cs, Am, and Nd nuclides were detected and in these data the fuel burn- up was determined, 2.57% of heavy atoms (h.a.). The work [3] presents data on the 14C speciﬁ c activity. In studies [4, 5], a method was developed for determining the 3H speciﬁ c activity in the SNF MNUP. The authors of [6] report data on determining the weight content of 232U and 236Pu nuclides in the SNF MNUP by the α-spectrometry method. This study presents the results of comprehensive studies of samples of experimental MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 fast breeder reactor.  We studied two samples of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor. Data on the studied samples are presented in Table 1. The nuclide composition and weight content of ﬁ ssile materials and ﬁ ssion products in the MNUP SNF were studied in the following sequence: – determination of the MNUP SNF weight; – sample dissolution using a dissolution apparatus equipped with a reﬂ ux condenser and a system of traps; – replacement of the reﬂ ux condenser with a refrigerator and partial distillation of the SNF solution with subsequent determination of the tritium speciﬁ c activity in the condensate;       – ﬁ ltration of the initial solution through a double cellulose ﬁ lter and analysis of the undissolved residue for the content of Zr, Mo, Pd, Rh, U, and Pu;   – dilution of the initial solution; – determination of the 106Ru speciﬁ c activity in the SNF working solution, on the walls of the reﬂ ux condenser, in trap solutions, and in undissolved residue; – α,γ-spectrometric analysis of the SNF working solution to estimate the volume of the aliquot required for the chromatographic separation of fractions; Fig. 2. Scheme of the apparatus for dissolving the SNF sample irradiated as part of KETVS-7. – carrying out sorption separation of nuclides U, Pu, Am-Cm-rare-earth fraction for mass-spectrometric measurements of the isotopic composition; – repetition of the sorption separation of nuclides U, Pu, Am-Cm-rare-earth fraction in the presence of a complex label to measure their weight content. To determine the fuel weight at the ﬁ rst stage, the sample with the fuel element cladding was weighed. Upon completion of the fuel dissolution, the cladding was removed, washed, dried, and weighed. The fuel weight content in the sample was found from the diﬀ erence between the weight of the sample with the fuel element cladding and the cladding weight. The weight of the sample and fuel cladding after dissolution was found on an analytical balance AX 205 (Mettler Toledo) with a weighing error of ±0.25 mg. The dissolution of the fuel sample irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was carried out in an apparatus (Fig. 1) [4]. The ﬁ rst trap is designed to capture ruthenium released during the dissolution of the SNF sample, the second is to absorb iodine isotopes, and three alkaline absorbers are to trap 14C released in the form of carbon dioxide. The purging rate of the apparatus volume with air was 1.2 L h–1. The dissolution of the fuel sample irradiated as part of combined experimental fuel assembly KETVS-7 was carried out in a dissolution apparatus (Fig. 2). The purging rate of the apparatus volume with an ozone–air mixture was 1.2 L h–1, which corresponds to an ozone supply rate of 2.5 × 10–2 g h–1. The change in the device design is due to the results of radiochemical studies of      SNF solution 1 M NHO3 HNO3 1 M NaOH NaOH      KETVS-1 KETVS-7 64 5 Coordinate of the cut from the fuel rod bottom, mm 1380–1430 1540–1552 Operating time of the assembly in the reactor, eﬀ ective days Fuel exposure time at the time of analysis, years 433.1 589.2 2.5 2.5              the MNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1, and a series of model experiments to prove the completeness of the oxidation of various carbon forms to CO2 and the capture of the resulting carbon dioxide by alkaline traps [3], as well as the results of testing KETVS-1 for the content of iodine isotopes. After cooling the MNUP SNF solution to room temperature, the reﬂ ux condenser was replaced with a refrigerator, and part of the SNF solution was distilled oﬀ at a temperature of 110–120°C. The condensate was collected in a 50 mL volumetric ﬂ ask. The tritium content was determined in view of a preset proportionality coeﬃ cient (Kpr), which takes into account the tritium fraction that passed from solution to condensate. At a volume of the MNUP SNF initial nitric acid solution of 250 mL and a condensate volume of 50 mL, Kpr = 0.24 ± 0.02 [4]. The activity of 3H in the condensate solution and 14C in alkaline solutions of Petri absorbers was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The part of the SNF solution remaining after distillation was ﬁ ltered through a double cellulose “blue ribbon” ﬁ lter 11.0 cm in diameter with a pore size of 1–3 μm to separate the undissolved residue. The ﬂ ask with the initial solution remains was washed three times with 1 M HNO3 (25 mL). The washing solutions were used to rinse the ﬁ lters and combined with the basic SNF solution remaining after distillation. The double cellulose ﬁ lter with the undissolved residue of the SNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was separated. Each ﬁ lter was dissolved, and the contents of U, Pu, Zr, Mo, Pd, and Rh were determined in the resulting solutions.  Uranium was determined by the spectrophotometric measurement of the light absorption of the uranium com- plex with arsenazo III; plutonium, by α-spectrometry; and ﬁ ssion products, by the atomic emission spectral method. The testing procedure is described in detail in [2]. At the ﬁ nal stage, 8 M HNO3 solution (200 mL) was added to a ﬂ ask with an undissolved fuel cladding, and control dissolution was carried out at a temperature of 95–100°C for 5 h. Upon dissolution process completion the α- and γ-spectrometric analyzes of the solutions were performed after the main and control dissolutions. The analytical line energies of radionuclides, their yields, as well as the half-lives for calculating the speciﬁ c activities of radionuclides when calculating their volumetric activity in term of concentration, were taken from [7, 8]. The isolation and puriﬁ cation of elements was car- ried out using a combination of cation-, anion-exchange, and extraction chromatograpy. The techniques devel- oped at RIAR were taken as the basis for the separation of SNF components. The isotopic composition of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, and Cm was determined in the isolated fractions. The analysis procedure is described in detail in [2–6, 9–11]. Quantitative determination of the U, Pu, Nd content was carried out by repeating the procedure for their isolation in the presence of a complex label by isotope dilution with mass spectrometric ending. To ﬁ nd the fuel burn-up depth, the value of 148Nd accumulation and the total 145Nd and 146Nd accumulation were used as monitors.

The analytical lines of the elements being determined, free from superposition of the U and Pu spectral lines were used: Mo 317.043; Pd 342.124, 340.458; Rh 343.489, 339.682; Ru 342.832; Zr 339.198, 327.926, 327.305 nm. The weight content of Mo, Zr, Rh, Pd, and Ru was calculated with the calibration curves constructed from reference samples. The analysis procedure is described in detail in [2]. The isotopic and elemental composition of the MNUP SNF was determined using the analytical equipment described in [2–6, 12].    The control dissolution of the fuel cladding was carried out upon completion of the dissolution process and separation of the undissolved residue. According to the data of α- and γ-spectrometric measurements of solutions, the content of α-emitters in the control solution is (3 ± 0.3) × 10–3% of their amount in the initial solution, content of γ-emitters is 0.1 ± 0.01%. The results of determining the burn-up depth, 3H, 14C, 106Ru speciﬁ c activities in MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor, in comparison with the results, which we obtained earlier for MNUP fuel irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor, are presented in Table 3. The discrepancy between the results of determining the tritium speciﬁ c activity is due to diﬀ erent types of reactor plants and fuel composition irradiation modes, as well as the degree of 3H diﬀ usion through the fuel cladding. Studies [13, 14] state that one of the main factors determining the tritium speciﬁ c activity in SNF is the fuel temperature at the irradiation time. As the temperature rises, the tritium content in the fuel composition diminishes. It was shown in [14–16] that tritium formed during SNF irradiation diﬀ uses through the fuel element cladding by 95–99%. Our data on the tritium speciﬁ c activity in the fuel cladding agree with the results of [17], where the tritium speciﬁ c activity in the fuel cladding with uranium oxide fuel and burn-up of 6.6–7.1% was 1.2 × 105 Bq/g. At the same time, it was found in [18] that the tritium content in the fuel element cladding of the VVER-440 reactor has a signiﬁ cant spread and is in the range from 3.9 × 106 to 3.4 × 107 Bq/g. The authors note that the uneven distribution of tritium is observed both along the height and along the circumference of the fuel-element cladding. They conclude that the main part of the tritium enters the cladding through areas of a damaged protective zirconium oxide ﬁ lm. From data presented in Table 3, it can be seen that the burn-up values of the MNUP SNF samples and the 14C speciﬁ c activity in them change symbatically. With increasing in the burn-up of the analyzed SNF sample by 23%, the 14C speciﬁ c activity increased by 25%. In the course of SNF dissolution, ruthenium is distributed over all elements of the dissolution apparatus: it partially remains in the SNF solution, condenses on the inner walls of the dephlegmator and connecting hoses, water cooler, enters the solution of the ﬁ rst Petri absorber containing the HNO3 solution, passes into the condensate solution produced at the tritium speciﬁ c activity determination stage, remains in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF.

It was established that the increase in the 106Ru speciﬁ c activity in the MNUP SNF samples is ahead of the growth in the fuel burn-up depth. With increasing the burn-up depth by 23%, the 106Ru speciﬁ c activity increased by 52%. This experimental fact requires additional veriﬁ cation. Iodine isotopes were not detected in any of the dissolution apparatus traps, nor in the initial solution, nor in the condensate obtained to determine the tritium speciﬁ c activity. According to the calculations performed using the SCALE 4.4А package, the 129I speciﬁ c activity in the MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor with a burn-up of 70 MW day/kg (Uref) and holding after irradiation for 2 years should be 2.93 × 109 Bq/t, the remaining iodine isotopes either are absent or are contained in negligibly small amounts, for example, the 131I content is 6.5 × 10–11 Bq/t. Taking into account the weight of the analyzed SNF sample irradiated as part of KETVS-1, in the 200 mL initial solution, the calculated content of 129I should          The content in the solution of MNUP SNF, kg/t Content in undissolved residue of MNUP SNF, kg/t     Content of U, mg Content of Pu, mg Fraction of U in the ﬁ lter, % of the total Fraction of Pu in the ﬁ lter, % of the total Upper 8.5 ± 0.4 0.6 ± 0.06 0.3 Lower 6.0 ± 0.3 0.8 ± 0.08 0.2   be 8.2 × 103 Bq, and the 129I speciﬁ c activity will be 41 Bq/mL. For radiochemical studies of SNF samples, a hundredfold dilution of the initial solution is utilizsed. We failed to determine the 129I content in a dilute solution against the background of other SNF components. For detecting iodine, it is necessary to develop special procedures for its isolation from a SNF sample. The results of determining the isotopic composition and weight content of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, Cm in the MNUP SNF are given in Table 4. In parentheses are the values of the total absolute error in units of the last digits of the result for a conﬁ dence level of 0.95. When ﬁ ltering the MNUP SNF solution through a double cellulose ﬁ lter, a light gray coating was observed on the upper ﬁ lter. The sediment weight could not be ﬁ xed, since the initial weight of the cellulose ﬁ lter turned out to be greater than the weight of the ﬁ lter with sediment. This experimental fact is probably associated with the destruction of cellulose under the action of α- and γ-emitting nuclides. According to the data of [19–21], the sediment weight upon uranium oxide SNF dissolution in nitric acid is no more than 0.6% of the dissolved fuel weight. It was found in [22] that, upon dissolution of irradiated mixed-oxide fuel with a burn- up of 31.7 to 54.7 GW/t in 3 HNO3 at 95°С, the the undissolved sediment weight does not exceed 1.3% of the SNF weight. When studying the dissolution of model nitride SNF [23], the volumes of 7.8 and 9.44 M HNO3 required for dissolution were calculated based on the nal concentration of metals in the solution: 280 and ﬁ 400 g/L, respectively. It is shown that the weight of the undissolved residue is 1.8 and 2.26%, respectively. The results of detecting the content of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the solution and the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 5. The presence of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr was registered only on the upper cellulose ﬁ lter; there were no these elements on the lower ﬁ lter. The content of these elements in the solution obtained after the dissolution of the upper ﬁ lter was equivalent to their content in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF. The total weight of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 was 0.0019 g, which is 0.07% of the dissolved SNF weight. The results of determining the uranium and plutonium content in the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 6. The data in Table 6 indicate that the U and Pu contents in the upper and lower ﬁ lters are comparable. The close values of these quantities evidence that most of the U and Pu we found in solutions after the dissolution of the lters were sorbed by cellulose. ﬁ The excess of the U content in the upper ﬁ lter compared to the lower ﬁ lter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds. The weight of undissolved U estimated from the diﬀ erence between the U weight on the upper and lower ﬁ lters, is 2.5 mg, or 0.09% of the total uranium content in the analyzed SNF sample.  For the ﬁ rst time, destructive radiochemical studies were carried out and experimental data were obtained on the composition of mixed nitride uranium-plutonium spent fuel irradiated in a fast breeder reactor. A complex technique for conducting destructive radiochemical studies, including dissolution, fractionation of SNF components, and measurements using nuclear-physical methods of analysis: α-, γ-, liquid scintillation, isotope dilution mass spectrometry, emission spectral analysis, was proposed and tested with real SNF. The isotopic composition and weight content of U, Pu, Am, Cm, Nd nuclides were measured, the 106Ru, 14C, 3H speciﬁ c activities, and the mass contents of Mo, Pd, Rh, and Zr in the solution and in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF were found.    The data obtained make it possible to carry out a computational analysis and veriﬁ cation of the computational codes in order to justify the radiation safety in the handling of MNUP SNF, and to optimize the methods of its processing.    1.
