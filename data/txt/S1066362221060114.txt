Isolation of 117mSn from Proton-irradiated Titanium–Antimony Intermetallic Compound  a Institute for Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117312 Russia *e-mail: lapshina@inr.ru  Abstract—Various methods have been developed for the extraction of a promising medical radionuclide 117mSn from proton-irradiated TiSb intermetallic compound, a target material suitable for irradiation with an intense beam of accelerated protons. To separate radiotin from Ti, Sb, and radionuclides of other elements, methods of ion- exchange chromatography and liquid extraction were used, in particular, the anion-exchange separation of tin and titanium in the form of a peroxide complex in HCl solution, extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions, and chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from citrate solutions. As a result, 117mSn of high purity, which meets the requirements for nuclear medicine, was obtained.

DOI: 10.1134/S1066362221060114 In recent decades, the therapy of oncological and other human diseases with the use of radiopharmaceuticals (RP) has developed signiﬁ cantly. More than 80% of cancer patients suﬀ er from bone metastases [1]. Interstitial radionuclide therapy using RP based on radionuclides releasing electrons is one of the eﬀ ective methods of treating patients with widespread bone metastases. RP based on the 117mSn radionuclide (in particular, 117mSn4+DTPA) [2–5] have a number of advantages over other drugs. The decay of the metastable radionuclide 117mSn is accompanied by the release of monoenergetic conversion electrons (127, 129, and 152 keV) with a short and discrete range of 0.2–0.3 mm in biological tissue. Soft radiation leads to a local eﬀ ect on tumor cells without damaging healthy tissues. The γ-radiation (159 keV) during the decay of 117mSn may be used to control the therapeutic eﬀ ect (theranostics). Clinical trials of drugs 117mSn4+DTPA for the relief of bone pain, 117mSn4+DOTA-annexin for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and the 117mSn colloid for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are being successfully carried out [1, 6]. Until recently, 117mSn was produced mainly from the reactions of stable tin isotopes, 116Sn(n,γ)117mSn or 117Sn(n,n’γ)117mSn, with neutrons. In this case, the speciﬁ c activity of 117mSn did not exceed 740 GBq/g (20 Ci/g) [2, 7]. The presence of stable tin seriously limits the possibilities of medical application of the reactor-produced 117mSn. A product with a high speciﬁ c activity can be obtained via reactions with accelerated charged particles, of which two approaches are the most promising and demonstrate comparable production rates of 117mSn: nat,121,123Sb(p,x)117mSn [8, 9] and 116Cd(α,3n)117mSn [10,11]. Nowadays, powerful and compact cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type, developed and manufactured by the IBA Company (Belgium), are becoming more widespread, capable of accelerating proton beams with an intensity of more than 300 μA to an energy of 70 MeV. Such cyclotrons are successfully applied for large-scale production of radioisotopes, mainly for medical purposes [12, 13]. On the basis of experimentally determined cross sections, it was shown [14] that the 117mSn radionuclide can be produced by proton irradiation of an antimony target with an initial energy of 145 MeV and below. Irradiation of natural antimony or antimony enriched with 123Sb with the proton energy 55 or 70 MeV, respectively, leads to the formation of 117mSn, which contains a trace amount of the undesirable long-lived radioisotope 113Sn. The presence of another long-lived radioisotope 119mSn (Т1/2 = 293 days), as impurity, which releases soft    gamma radiation during decay into stable 119Sn, does not interfere with medical use of 117mSn. Therefore, the implementation of the nat,123Sb(p,x)117mSn approach on cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type for producing large amounts of 117mSn of medical quality seems especially promising. In [15], we proposed a method for obtaining no-carrier-added 117mSn from a thick target of metallic antimony irradiated with protons. After dissolution of the antimony target, the radiotin was isolated by liquid- liquid extraction (LLE) with dibutyl ether, followed by exhaustive puriﬁ cation on silica gel. The method provides production of up to 3 Ci (100 GBq) 117mSn of high radionuclidic purity with a speciﬁ c activity of about 1000 Ci/g (more than 40 GBq/mg). However, since metallic antimony has low thermal conductivity, low melting point and high vapor pressure, antimony targets cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high-intensity proton currents. In addition, antimony actively interacts with many materials that are usually used for the manufacture of the target shell, which leads to its radiation damage. Instead of metallic antimony, intermetallic compounds, such as TiSb, NiSb, and AlSb, were considered as a target material, of which TiSb turned out to be the most promising [16]. The TiSb properties, unique in many respects, have been studied since the 1950s [17]. The compound combines high stability (the enthalpy of formation is estimated as –167 kJ/mol [18]), and a high melting point of 1160°C with pronounced metallic properties, including high electrical and thermal conductivity. According to our estimate, the value of the latter is twice the thermal conductivity of titanium and antimony taken separately. In the chemical separation of 117mSn from irradiated TiSb, it is necessary to remove not only macro-quantites of antimony, but also macroquantites of titanium. Previously, removal of antimony was studied in [15]. Removal of titanium is diﬃ cult due to the similarity of its chemical behavior with that of tin; in the few studies described in the literature, extraction and chromatographic separation methods are used. Sn(IV) can be extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone from 7 M HCl solutions, while Ti(IV) remains in the aqueous phase [19]. Then, the tin is reextracted with dilute solutions of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid [20]. In analytical practice, tin is also extracted with benzene from HI solutions. The extraction of tin with  benzene proceeds most eﬃ ciently at a perchloric acid content of 4.66 M, sulfuric acid content of 1 M (total acidity 6.6 M), and a potassium iodide content of 0.5 M. In this case, titanium and antimony, as well as I–III metals, including indium and scandium, are not extracted [21]. Tin is reextracted with a 1–2 M HCl solution. However, this technique was developed only for the analytical determination of milligram amounts of tin [22]; its applicability for isolation of no-carrier- added radiotin has not been studied. Chromatographic separation of Ti(IV) from ions of other metals is possible by sorption of titanium in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on a weakly basic anion exchanger Amberlite CG-4B [23]. A similar behavior of Ti(IV) is observed on AG 50W-X8 and Dowex 50W cation exchangers in 0.05 M H2SO4 solutions with the addition of 1% H2O2 [24]. Ti(IV) is not adsorbed on strongly basic anion-exchange resins (Dowex 1×8 and AG 1 × 8) [25]. As known, Ti forms peroxide complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+, positively charged and stable in strongly acidic solutions. At the same time, Sn forms the anionic complex [SnCl6]2– in strong hydrochloric acid solutions; therefore, the separation of oppositely charged Sn and Ti complexes can be carried out both on cation-exchange and anion-exchange resins. For example, when a hydrochloric acid solution of Sn and Ti containing a minor excess of H2O2, is passed through an anion-exchange resin, [SnCl6]2– anions are adsorbed, whereas [TiO(H2O2)] cations pass through the column. Then, tin is desorbed by passing through the column solutions that decompose the [SnCl6]2– anionic complex. For separating trace amounts of tin from macroquantites of titanium, this method is preferable, since it does not require large volumes of sorbent. Basically, the methods presented in the literature have been developed for the separation of macroquantities of Sn, Sb, and Ti, while the behavior of radionuclides in the “no-carrier-added” state can diﬀ er signiﬁ cantly. When producing 117mSn of high speciﬁ c activity, it is necessary to separate the macroquantites of Sb and Ti from the ul- tramicroquantities of Sn. In addition, proton irradiation of antimony and titanium produces other radionuclides, capable of aﬀ ecting purity of the target product, and they must also be separated from tin. In this study, we propose options for the extraction of 117mSn with a high speciﬁ c activity from the proton-irradiated antimony– titanium intermetallic compound to prepare RP.    Preparation and irradiation of experimental targets. The radionuclides 124Sb (carrier-added), 113Sn, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn (no-carrier-added) used in this study for model experiments were obtained from irradiated antimony targets by the method described in [9]. 44Ti was supplied by CJSC Cyclotron (Obninsk). Antimony–titanium intermetallic compound was formed by argon-arc melting of antimony and titanium powder in a molar ratio of 1: 1 [16]. To prepare the target, the crushed intermetallide was placed in an electron-beam welded titanium container 5 mm thick and was heated at a temperature of 910°C and a pressure of 150 MPa in argon for 1.5 h [26]. To produce radionuclides and study their chemical behavior, targets from the TiSb intermetallic compound and also from metallic antimony were irradiated. The activity of the used radionuclides was in the range of several μCi (~ 100 kBq). Irradiation was carried out at a high-precision accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research (Troitsk, Moscow) with the initial proton beam energy varied from 110 to 140 MeV and at the current 1–50 μA [27]. Materials and reagents. For preparing aqueous solutions, we used concentrated acids (HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4) and deionized water from a Millipore Simplicity water puriﬁ cation unit. Antimony was extracted with dibutyl ether. For chromatographic separation of titanium, we used: (1) strongly basic monofunctional anionites AG 1×8 (Bio Rad, USA) and Dowex 1×8 (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –N+(CН3)3 as the mai functional group; (2) Dowex 50×8 cation exchanger (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –SO3H as the main functional group. Particle size is 100 mesh, crosslinking, 8%, and bulk density of resins, 0.8 g/mL. Macroquantites of titanium were removed by extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone, benzene, and KI (all chemically pure grade). The ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of the radiotin was carried out by chromatography on silica gel with a particle size of 100–160 μm. The reagents were of special purity or chemically pure grade. Experimental technique. In model solutions used to develop the technique for separating radiotin from the titanium – antimony intermetallide, the maximum concentrations of the macrocomponents were 75 and 30 g/L for antimony and titanium, respectively. The above concentrations were chosen by assuming that the mass of the target for the production of large amounts of 117mSn is about 40 g, of which 29 g are antimony and 11 g, titanium. Most of the antimony in the presence of titanium was separated by extraction with dibutyl ether from a 10 M HCl solution [15].   For the chromatographic puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, we prepared 10 mL of model solutions containing Ti, Sb, H2O2, 6 M HCl, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe , and 114mIn). The content of Ti varied from 1.5 to 30 g/L, the Sb content varied from (2–5)×10–3 g/L, a value corresponding to the addition of the 124Sb label, to 14.4 g/L, the H2O2 : Ti molar ratio was from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1. The label was obtained from an irradiated antimony target. The sorption and desorption of tin was performed under dynamic conditions by passing the solution through a column (d = 0.6 cm) with a sorbent layer 6 cm high. Two anion-exchange resins were used as sorbents: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Before ﬁ lling the column, the sorbents were kept in 6 M HCl for 12 h. First, 10 mL of the initial solution was passed through the ﬁ lled column at a rate of 0.8 mL/min and then 40–50 mL of a 6 M HCl washing solution passed. For desorption of radiotin, 1–4 M HNO3 solutions were used. Model solutions used for extraction have a total acidity of 6.6 M and a volume of 30 mL and contain 4.66 М HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, Ti (20 g/L), Sb in the form of antimony chloride with a concentration from (2– 5)×10–3 to 1 g/L, and 0.2–1 М KI. Also, (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn) produced from the irradiated antimony target was added to the model solution as label. To prepare a model solution, a weighed portion of KI was preliminarily dissolved in a minor amount of water and added, with vigorous stirring, to a mixture of HClO4 and H2SO4 acids. Iodine was formed, and the larger the weight of KI sample, the darker the solution. However, even at low KI concentrations, when the solution was light yellow, a precipitate formed, presumably HIO. The solution was left for a day to reach equilibrium. Then, it was ﬁ ltered, and the label and stable titanium and antimony were added, and after that, the extraction was performed. The prepared solution was stored for no more than a week. As the organic phase, we used benzene previously saturated with a solution of 4.66 М HClO4 +     Radionuclide 114mIn       123mTe 44Ti         Eγ, kEv 190.3 558.4 725.2 255.1 391.7 (113mIn) 156.0 158.6 602.7 1691.0 212.2 1002.1  67.9 78.3 889.3 1120.5  15.6 4.4 4.4 2.1 65.0 2.1 86.4 97.8 47.6 81.5 2.5  93.0 96.4 99.98 99.99 1 M H2SO4. Extraction from 30 mL of the working solution was carried out successively with two portions of benzene, 10 mL each. At each stage, the stirring time of the phases was 30–40 s, and separation time, 10 min. The radiotin was reextracted in 60 mL of 1.5 M HCl (stirring time 5–6 min, and separation time, 17–20 min). At the ﬁ nal stage, exhaustive puriﬁ cation and concentration of radiotin on silica gel from a model solution of 2 M HNO3 labeled with 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was performed, according to the procedure described in detail in [15]. To study the interaction of the TiSb intermetallic compound with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were dissolved by heating in concentrated HCl, to which H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 were added, as oxidizing agent. The completeness of dissolution was controlled by weighing the undissolved residue. The content of titanium and antimony in the residue and the concentration of antimony in the solution were calculated from results of the spectrophotometric determination of the titanium concentration in the solution. For testing the developed technique, we manufac- tured, irradiated, and processed an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound. An intermetallic compound with a mass of 16 g was dissolved according to the procedure worked out on nonirradiated samples. The concentration of antimony  and titanium in the working solution was 60 and 24 g/L, respectively. Most of the antimony was removed from the solution by extraction with dibutyl ether (three stages of extraction with dibutyl ether, previously saturated with 10 M HCl [15]). One portion of the aqueous phase was puriﬁ ed from titanium by chromatography on anion exchangers, and the other, by extraction with benzene from iodide solu- tions using the optimal conditions found in model experi- ments. The ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of radiotin on silica gel from citrate solutions was performed, as described in [15].  radionuclides (Table 1) present in the solution and on the sorbent were determined by the γ-spectrometric method with a high purity ORTEC GEM15P4-70 Ge detector. The γ-spectra were interpreted using the Gamma Vision 32 software. To analyze the chemical behavior of the radiotin, we used not only the target radionuclide 117mSn, but also the longer-lived impurity 113Sn. Macroquantities of titanium were determined spec- trophotometrically with hydrogen peroxide (absorption maximum 416 nm, e416 = 810 L/mol cm) and dianti- pyrylmethane (DAM). Ti (IV) forms a strong complex compound with DAM in 0.5–4 M HCl with an absorp- tion maximum at 389 nm. The absorption coeﬃ cient e389 = 3.3 104 L/mol cm is much higher than that of H2O2. The determination technique is described in [29].   Table 2.

In the case of the separation of 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound, the task is complicated by the need to purify also from titanium, which also exhibits chemical properties close to that of tin. Therefore, the main task of this study was the eﬃ cient separation, providing a high chemical yield, of radiotin from the macrocomponents of antimony and titanium. For puriﬁ cation from the main amount of antimony in the presence of titanium, we used extraction with dibutyl ether, which was described previously in the absence of titanium in [15]. Extraction was performed from a model 10 M HCl solution containing 55 g/L Sb, 20 g/L Ti, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, and 44Ti) (Table 2). The study showed that following three successive extractions, more than 99.7% of antimony passes into dibutyl ether, while radiotin and titanium remain in the aqueous phase. After the ﬁ rst stage of extraction, the concentration of antimony decreases to 1.5 g/L. After three stages, it may be reduced to 0.1 g/ L. More than 95% of titanium and radiotin remain in the aqueous phase. It was found that the extraction of antimony in the presence of titanium proceeds in the same way as in its absence. For the subsequent puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium macroquantities, both chromatography on strong anion exchangers with the addition of hydrogen peroxide and extraction with benzene from iodide solutions were used.  from titanium. According to the literature data [24], Ti (IV) is well sorbed on the Dowex 50W-X8 cation exchanger in the presence of hydrogen peroxide due to the formation  of positively charged complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+. These complexes are stable in acidic media, including HCl, in which tin forms the anionic complexes [SnCl6]2–. Our preliminary experiments showed that Ti macroquantities are not sorbed from 2 M HCl and are not completely sorbed from 1 M HCl. The ion-exchange separation of radiotin from titanium was carried out from 0.5 M HCl, while the titanium concentration was reduced by a factor of 20. However, this method is not entirely suitable for solving our problem, since large volumes of sorbent are required to remove macroamounts of titanium, which should be disposed and lead to the loss of radiotin. The separation of radiotin from titanium on strongly basic anion exchangers turned out to be more promising approach. The above possibility was studied on model solutions. The chromatographic procedure consisted of passing a hydrochloric acid solution of radiotin and titanium, containing a small stoichiometric excess of H2O2, through an anion exchange resin. In this case, [SnCl6]2– anions were sorbed on the column, while [TiO(H2O2)]2+ cations passed through the column. The column was washed with 6 M HCl to remove titanium. The titanium concentration in the washing solution and, as a consequence, in the target product depended on the degree of puriﬁ cation of the initial solution from macroamounts of antimony (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that an increase in the antimony concentration has adverse eﬀ ect on the puriﬁ cation from titanium. Next, we compared the eﬃ ciency of puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, tellurium, and antimony residues on two strongly basic anion exchangers: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Both resins, similar in composition but diﬀ ering in brands, have approximately the same eﬀ ect in relation to tin, tellurium, and antimony radionuclides. At the same time, they diﬀ er in relation to titanium (Fig. 2). Figure 2 shows that titanium is more easily washed out of a     Fig. 2.

Therefore, further experiments were performed with AG 1 × 8 resin. After washing, part of tellurium remains on the column, in addition to radiotin. Radiotin was eluted with a nitric acid solution, which decomposes the anionic complex. Table 3 shows the dependence of the amount of radiotin remaining in the adsorbed state on the nitric acid concentration. With an increase in the HNO3 concentration, the yield of radiotin increases, while tellurium radionuclides start to desorb simultaneously. Optimal for elution is 2 M HNO3. In this case, a radiotin yield of about 90% is achieved, and the content of tellurium radionuclides is reduced by about 2-fold. Heating nitric acid to 40°C increases the radiotin yield up to 98%. A high content of antimony in the initial solution not only has adverse eﬀ ect on the removal of titanium, but also decreases the yield of radiotin, which can be seen from the integral curves of 113Sn elution at various concentrations of antimony in the initial solutions (Fig. 3). Increasing the antimony concentration in the solution to 3.6 g/L reduces the radiotin yield to 90%. Thus, the presence of antimony with a concentration on the order of 1 g/L will be quite acceptable for eﬃ cient separation of 117mSn and titanium at this stage. Change in the chromatographic behavior can be followed in Fig.4, demonstrating curves of elution of antimony from the column upon washing with a 6 M HCl and desorption of radiotin in a 2 M HNO3 on the antimony concentration in the initial solution. As seen, with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, it is less retained by the sorbent upon passage of 6 M HCl and is desorbed with 2 M HNO3 by a broader peak. Based on the above dependences, the following optimal parameters of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and titanium were determined:   Table 3.

Antimony concentration, g/L: (1) (2–5) 10–3, (2) 3.6, and (3) 14.4. – the concentration of antimony in the initial solution should be on the order of 1 g/L, i.e. most of the antimony should be previously removed, by extraction with dibutyl ether in particular; HCl + 7 M LiCl reaches 96%, whereas the titanium concentration decreases only 60 times. Thus, this method does not allow for complete puriﬁ cation of the radiotin from titanium macroquantities in a high yield.   – selective elution of titanium with respect to radiotin should be carried out in a 6 M HCl (for a chromatographic column volume of 2.5–3 mL and a sorbent layer height of 6–7 cm, 50 mL of 6 M HCl is suﬃ cient). For desorption of radiotin, a 2 M HNO3 solution heated to 40°C should be used; with the above column parameters, 25 mL of 2 M HNO3 is suﬃ cient to extract 98–99% of the radiotin. The puriﬁ cation factor from Ti depends on its concentration in the initial solution and reaches 104 at a titanium concentration of 25 g/L; a puriﬁ cation factor of up to 106 may be achieved after two stages of chromatographic puriﬁ cation. Extraction separation of radiotin from titanium. Along with the chromatographic method, extraction methods are also used to separate radiotin from titanium macroquantities. One of these methods is extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone [19]. Our model experiments showed that methyl isobutyl ketone extracts up to 80% of radiotin from 7 M HCl, while the titanium concentration decreases 200 times. The extraction of radiotin from a solution of 7 M Another extraction method of separation from titanium, providing up to 99-% yield, is the extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions. This method was studied for the separation of milligram amounts of tin from titanium and antimony in [21]. The behavior of a no-carrier-added tin may diﬀ er from the behavior of macroscopic amounts of tin. The diﬀ erence in the extraction behavior of tin is mainly inﬂ uenced by the concentration of stable antimony and iodide ions. It was shown in [15] that after the removal of antimony by extraction with dibutyl ether, a minor amount of it nevertheless remains in the solution. At the ﬁ rst stage, the eﬀ ect of the concentration of antimony in the initial solution on the extraction of radiotin with benzene was studied. In this case, the KI concentration was kept constant (0.5 M). In the studied range of antimony concentrations (2–5) × 10–3–1 g/L, at least 98% of radiotin is extracted with two 10-mL portions of benzene. The dependence of the extraction of antimony on its concentration in the initial solution is demonstrated in Fig. 5. As seen, the more antimony in the initial solution, the more it is extracted into the organic phase (salting out eﬀ ect). Therefore, the antimony concentration should be minimal.                      Fig. 5. Dependences of the fraction of extracted antimony (1) and the concentration of titanium in the reextract (2) on the concentration of antimony in the initial solution. Fig. 6. Loss on the sediment formed in the organic phase after extraction and on the surface of chemical glassware. Curve: (1) antimony (124Sb) and (2) 113Sn. For reextraction of radiotin from the organic phase, we used 1.5 M HCl and 0.25 M H2SO4 solutions proposed in the literature [22]. The eﬃ ciencies of reextraction with solutions of both acids were found to be close. Since further puriﬁ cation was performed in hydrochloric acid solutions, 1.5 M HCl was used for reextraction. The inﬂ uence of the initial concentration of antimony on the reextraction was investigated. In particular, it was shown that with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, the puriﬁ cation degree of radiotin, reextracted from benzene, from titanium also decreases (Fig. 5). It was found that after a certain time (within an hour) elapsed after extraction, a white precipitate formed in the organic phase. For tin rextraction, the organic phase was decanted, with some radiotin remaining on the sediment and on the surface of the chemical glassware (Fig. 6). The inﬂ uence of the concentration of antimony and iodide ions in the initial solution on the loss of radionu- clides in the sediment was studied. As seen, the loss of ra- diotin in the sediment increases with increasing antimony concentration (Fig. 6). To minimize the loss, it is neces- sary to limit the interval between extraction and reextrac- tion, and also to reduce the concentration of antimony in the initial solution to 0.1 g/L. But even at this minimum concentration the amount of precipitate increases with an increase in the KI concentration. The loss of radiotin in the KI concentration range studied, 0.2–1 M, was within 10–15%, and the content of antimony in the precipitate increased with KI concentration. Since titanium is not  extracted in signiﬁ cant quantities, antimony remains the only macrocomponent that can lead to insoluble com- pounds. Based on the fact that the content of antimony in the precipitate increases with concentrations of both antimony and KI, it can be assumed that the precipitate is Sb(V) iodide or its derivatives. The eﬀ ect of the concentration of iodide ions on the course of extraction was studied at the constant concentration of antimony in the initial solution equal to 0.1 g/L. It was found that, in the concentration range studied, 0.2–1 M, the KI concentration dramatically aﬀ ects the extraction of radiotin and antimony: at low concentra- tions, antimony is extracted, while up to 70% of radiotin remains in the aqueous phase. With an increase in the KI concentration, the behavior of the elements changes: the radiotin quantitatively leaves the aqueous phase, while the antimony remains (Fig. 7). Analysis of the obtained experimental data showed that more than 98% of titani- um and tellurium radionuclides remained in the aqueous phase after extraction with benzene. In addition, iodide ions contribute to a more complete separation of radio- tin from titanium. With KI concentration increased from 0.2 to 1 mol/L, the degree of puriﬁ cation from titanium is increased by a factor of 4–5. Based on the above dependences, the optimal parameters of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium were selected: – the concentration of antimony in the initial solu- tion should be below 0.1 g/L, i.e. it must ﬁ rst be re- moved, for example, by extraction with dibutyl ether;              2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2   Radiotin desorbate     Fig. 7. Fraction of antimony (1) and radiotin (2) remained in the aqueous phase after extraction, depending on the concentration of KI in the initial solution. Fig. 8.

Column 0.6 cm in diameter and 6 cm in height, ﬂ ow rate 0.6 mL/min. – the optimal composition of the aqueous phase is 4.66 М HClO4 + 1 M H2SO4 + (0.5–1) М KI, the the organic phase is benzene, previously saturated with a solution of 4.66 М HClO4 + 1 M H2SO4;     Thus, titanium can be almost completely removed from radiotin by extraction with benzene, whereas trace amounts of antimony and tellurium present in the product may be removed by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel. On processing an irradiated antimony target, such a ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation was performed in a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5), which, in turn, was prepared from a 10 M HCl solution, which is determined by the previous stage of processing described in [15]. In the case of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, a sodium citrate solution was prepared from a 1.5 M HCl solution, and in the case of chromatographic separation on AG 1 × 8 resin, the preceding solution was 2 M HNO3, not HCl. We checked how traces of nitrate ions aﬀ ect the chromatography eﬃ ciency on silica gel, the formation of antimony complexes with citrate ions in particular. To do this, a citrate solution containing 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was prepared starting from a 2 M HNO3. The solution was passed through a column ﬁ lled with SiO2, then the column was washed, and radiotin was eluted with 6 M HCl according to the method described in [15]. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 8. It follows from Fig. 5 that the radionuclides Sn, Sb, and Te behave in the same way, as in the absence of nitrate aions. In this case, about 45% of 44Ti remains on the column. Isolation of radiotin from an irradiated TiSb sample. After the process of radiotin separation was studied in model experiments, an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound was fabricated and irradiated. The chemical and physical properties of TiSb have been little studied. To study the interaction of TiSb with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were successively dissolved in concentrated HCl and then in concentrated HCl with the addition of HNO3. Heating TiSb in concentrated hydrochloric acid caused solution to turn violet (owing to the formation of Ti3+ ions). As the sample dissolved, the reaction rate decreased. The addition of H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 leads to the resumption of dissolution. However, in this case, Ti3+ transforms into Ti4+, causing precipitation and passivation of the TiSb surface. We succeeded in performing complete dissolution as follows. The bead of the compound was placed in a ﬂ ask, and a concentrated HCl was added. The ﬂ ask was heated for 12 h at reﬂ ux temperature. Solution (no. 1) turned deep violet, indicating the formation of Ti3+ ions. Then, the insoluble residue was transferred into a ﬂ ask with a fresh portion of concentrated HCl, and  Titanium (44Ti) Antimony (124Sb) 113Sn 121mTe                    Fig. 9.

Column 0.8 cm in diameter and 8 cm in height, ﬂ ow rate 0.8 mL/min. a concentrated HNO3 was added dropwise on heating. Violent dissolution and formation of a white suspension was observed. After 4 h, dissolution was complete. After cooling the thus obtained solution (no. 2), the precipitate was ﬁ ltered oﬀ . To the solution (no. 1) a ﬁ ltered solution (no. 2) was added. This method was used to dissolve an experimental TiSb sample irradiated in an accelerator. It was shown that radiotin is not adsorbed on the formed sediment at the acidity above 3 M HCl. The composite solution was transferred into a 10 M HCl solution, and macroquantites of antimony were removed by extraction with dibutyl ether. Since model experiments demonstrated the possibility of puriﬁ cation from titanium macroquantities both by extraction and by chromatography, the solution obtained after removing antimony was divided into two portions to test both methods. The ﬁ rst portion was puriﬁ ed from titanium on a chromatographic column, and the second portion, by extraction with benzene from iodide solutions. For chromatographic puriﬁ cation on an AG 1 × 8 column, the solution was diluted to 6 M HCl. Results of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and Ti are demonstrated in Fig. 9. Passing the initial solution and subsequent washing the column with a 6 M HCl caused titanium to wash out of the column in the form of a positively charged complex [TiO(H2O2)]2+ and as trivalent cations of indium and scandium radioisotopes, while radiotin and antimony in the form of anionic complexes [SbCl6]– and [SnCl6]2– retained by the sorbent together with tellurium radioisotopes. When the mobile phase is changed for a 2 M HNO3 solution, the complexes of tin and antimony decompose, and desorption of these elements and also a part of Table 4.

For the ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of the radiotin, chromatographic separation on silica gel was carried out as described above. As a result, the total yield of 117mSn was 75–82%, the puriﬁ cation factors for Sb and Ti were about 106, and the radionuclidic purity of 117mSn was no less than 99.9% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated). Second portion of the solution prepared by dissolving TiSb was transferred into a solution containing 4.66 M HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, and 1 M KI, and the radiotin was extracted twice with benzene. Then, radiotin was reextracted from benzene with 1.5 M HCl. Like chromatography, this method provided puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, indium, and scandium radionuclides. Trace amounts of antimony and tellurium impurities (Table 4) remained after the extraction were removed by further adsorption on silica gel from citrate solutions. In the given case, the total yield of 117mSn was 80– 85%, the puriﬁ cation factor for Sb and Ti, about 106, and the radionuclidic purity was no less than 99.7% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated).    To conclude, the processes of separation of no-carrier- added 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound irradiated with protons have been investigated. The dissolution of TiSb in the HCl and HNO3 acids with the addition of HNO3 and H2O2 has been studied. It was shown that the presence of titanium in the resulting solutions does not impede the eﬀ ective extraction of most of the antimony with dibutyl ether. For further separation of radiotin from macroquantities of titanium, both chromatography and extraction can be used. Using the chromatography method, we studied the possibility of separating radiotin in the form of [SnCl6]2– from titanium in the form of an oppositely charged complex [TiO (H2O2)]2+ on strong AG 1 × 8 and    Extraction Bu2O: 10 M HCl   Chromatography AG 1 × 8 1.

In the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, the best results were achieved for the extraction of radiotin with benzene from a solution containing a mixture of perchloric and sulfuric acids and iodide ions with a concentration of 0.5–1 M. Each of the methods used has its own advantages and disadvantages [30]. In our case, the advantage of extraction in comparison with chromatography is the short time of the process, and the disadvantage is a slightly lower yield of radiotin and worsening of its puriﬁ cation from titanium at a residual concentration of antimony in the initial solution above 0.1 g/L. In our opinion, the method of titanium separation on the AG 1 × 8 anion exchanger is most preferable, since it, although being more time-consuming, is less sensi- tive to the antimony content in the initial solution (about 1 g/L), and is also easier-to-implement in hot chambers. In both methods, the separation of radiotin was terminated by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate at pH 5.5. As a result, the 117mSn product with high radionuclidic purity and high speciﬁ c activity was obtained in at least 75-% yield, which is promising for the development of production technology of 117mSn in large quantities in the future.
