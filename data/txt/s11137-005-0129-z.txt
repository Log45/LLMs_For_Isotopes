Development of Diffusion-Thermal Methods for Preparing 67Cu and 124I for Radionuclide Therapy and Positron Emission Tomography  * St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russia ** Prometei Central Research Institute of Structural Materials, St. Petersburg, Russia *** Russian Research Centre Kurchatov Institute, Moscow, Russia   Abstract(cid:0)Diffusion-thermal procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I for radionuclide therapy and positron emission tomography are suggested. For these procedures, new cyclotron targets of metallic tantalum were developed, which, when exposed to high irradiation doses, ensure the absence of physicochemical interaction (diffusion, alloying) of materials being activated and final products with the support at high temperatures. The thermal, hydrodynamic, and strength characteristics of zinc and tellurium (elemental Te) cyclotron targets were evaluated. For commercial target assembly of the COSTIS system, the operation parameters of the proc- ess for preparing 124I from elemental tellurium using the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerators were determined. Recent efforts of leading scientific laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Hammersmith Hospital, etc.) were focused on the development of procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I [1(cid:0)3]. This is due to the unique nuclear-physical properties of 67Cu and 124I, possibility of their production on compact cyclotrons, accelerators of high-energy charged particles, electron accelerators, and moderate-power reactors, and also to rich and well-studied chemistry of these elements. 67Cu is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 2.58 days) undergoing (cid:2)-decay (100%) [4]. A short path of elec- trons with the energy from 181.5 to 575.0 keV in a living body allows elimination of tumors with a diam- eter of up to 5 mm [5]. The inherent (cid:3)-ray radiation of this radionuclide, whose energy spectrum and quan- tum yield (see below) are similar to those of 67Ga widely used in single-photon emission tomography, is efficiently registered with a commercial scintillation (cid:3)-ray chamber providing reliable monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patientâ€™s body. E(cid:2), keV (%) [4] 390.4 (57.2) 481.7 (21.6) 575.0 (20.0) 181.5 (1.1) E(cid:3), keV (%) [4] 184.6 (48.7) 93.3 (16.1) 91.3 (7.0) One more undeniable advantage of 67Cu is forma- tion of stable compounds with monoclonal antibodies, which provides target transport of radiopharmaceuti- cals (RPs) to the affected organ, high radiation doses within this organ, very low irradiation of intact tissues, and restricted capacity of tumor cells to regenerate the DNA structure after irradiation with electrons. 124I is a positron emitter. Replacement of the key diagnostic radionuclide iodine-123 by 124I in known RPs such as solution of sodium iodide, solution of sodium o-iodohippurate, m-iodobenzylguanidine, and Iodofen would substantially improve these prepara- tions.      Accelerator irradiation with protons (energy up to 70 MeV). 67Cu can be prepared by the reactions 68Zn(p, 2p), Ethr 69Ga(p, 3p), Ethr 10.1 MeV; 16.8 MeV; and 71Ga(p, (cid:4)p + 4pn), Ethr 5.41 MeV, occurring in zinc or gallium targets upon proton ir- radiation. Zinc targets are preferable owing to the (1) simple procedures of their preparation; a typical target is a the material being activated (130 (cid:0) fine layer of 1000 (cid:5)m depending on the incidence angle of the charged particles on the enriched 68Zn target) de-    (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)  (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:4)  Radionuclide (T1/2, days) Reaction, Ethr, MeV Table 1.

Reactor irradiation. Preparation of 67Cu by the (n, p) reaction is not very promising because to low capture cross sections of thermal neutrons (0.64 (cid:0) 0.82 mb) [8(cid:0)10] and high content of the impurity 64Cu: in the case of (cid:6)natural(cid:7) zinc, the 67Cu : 64Cu ratio is 1 : 700 and at irradiation of enriched 67Zn (93.7% enrichment) the activity of 67Cu reaches only 25(cid:0)28% of the total activity of the target [11]. Irradiation with electron accelerators. Prepara- tion of 67Cu using the bremsstrahlung beams from electron accelerators seems the most promising. In one of the pioneering studies [12], 67Cu was prepared on a 25-MeV electron accelerator (beam current 8(cid:0) 10 (cid:5)A). In irradiation, the target [a stack of 2-mm discs 12 mm in diameter] was placed at a distance of 2 cm from the converter; the irradiation time was varied from 2 to 10 h. It was found that the activity of 67Cu decreases exponentially in the bremsstrahlung beam direction   (Fig. 1). The threshold of the 68Zn((cid:3), p) reaction is 9.99 MeV, and the capture cross section is maximal at 19 MeV. As seen from the (cid:3)-ray spectrometric data, along the targets contain 64Cu, with the desired product which is probably formed by the 66Zn((cid:3), np) reaction (Ethr 19 MeV). At a beam current of 10 (cid:5)A and irradiation time of 10 h, the yield of 67Cu from the 25-g target [a stack of (cid:6)natural(cid:7) zinc discs (12 mm in diameter), total thickness 30 mm] was 9.25 MBq. In the case of enriched 68Zn, the yield of 67Cu can be increased to 0.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1; simultaneously, the procedure of radiochemical treatment of the zinc targets becomes simpler. Taking into account rather limited number of high- energy accelerators [LANL; BNL; PSI; National Ac- celerator Centre, NAC; Faure (Republic of South Fig. 1. Accumulation of 67Cu and 64Cu in the course of ir- radiation of the zinc targets with the bremsstrahlung beam from an electron accelerator [12]; (A) activity.   the back side of the tantalum support with water, and the face side and the inlet titanium foil (50 (cid:5)m thick) separating the irradiated target and accelerator volume are additionally cooled with a helium flow. Below we analyze the feasibility of this approach in the develop- ment of new cyclotron targets (e.g., for more complex case such as accumulation of 124I from elemental tel- lurium, whose thermal conductivity is smaller than that of zinc by nearly 2 orders of magnitude).  Copper-67 can be isolated in a metallic vacuum chamber providing the residual pressure in the work- ing volume as low as 10(cid:2)6 mm Hg. The pilot model was presented previously in [14]; now in collaboration with the Institute of Analytical Instrument-Making we developed a new commercial installation. The chamber is equipped with special fittings for connect- ing a vacuum pump (turbomolecular pump is prefer- replaceable con- able), denser for the evaporated staring isotope and impurity gallium radionuclides, water supply unit, valves for inert gas supply, heater, and thermocouples. The con- denser is hermetically connected to a water supply unit, which is connected through a pipe with a water cooling system used in the course of distillation to maintain the required temperature. A furnace (equipped with a holder for irradiated target) is ar- ranged over the condenser using a movable rod; the required temperature is controlled with thermocouples.  Using the pilot vacuum chamber, we isolated the products of nuclear reactions from natural metal zinc irradiated with deuterons (13.6/6.0 MeV). Zinc was virtually quantitatively removed from the irradiated target: after treatment, no photopeaks at 0.4386 [69mZn, 68Zn(d, p)] and 1.116 MeV [65Zn, 64Zn(d, p)] were recorded. The yields of 66Ga [66Zn(d, 2n)], 67Ga [66Zn(d, n) and 67Zn(d, 2n)], and 64Cu [66Zn(d, (cid:4)) and 67Zn(d, (cid:4)n)] were about 98%, whereas the content of impurity zinc radionuclides was less than 0.02%. A significant difference in the vapor pressures of all the elements to be separated (Zn, Cu, Ga) in a wide temperature range (Fig. 2) should allow prepara- tion of 67Cu with a radionuclide purity of about 99%. PRODUCTION OF 124I USING TELLURIUM CYCLOTRON TARGETS    The most efficient way to prepare 124I is the reac- tion 124Te(p, n), which can be performed on compact   Fig. 2.

Africa), TRIUMF (Vancouver, Canada), Institute of Nuclear Research (Troitsk, Moscow oblast, Russia); Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics (Moscow, Russia); and St. Petersburg Institute of Nuclear Physics (Gatchina, Leningrad oblast, Russia)], the above procedure of 67Cu production seems the most promising.  Irrespective of the procedure of radionuclide ac- cumulation, 67Cu can be isolated by vacuum distilla- tion separation of the irradiated zinc targets performed at temperature and pressure providing their complete removal and excluding evaporation of the desired product. This procedure is based on the difference of the evaporation rates and partial vapor pressures of the elements being separated over the solid phase [13]. This method requires changes in the common design of the cyclotron targets (copper or silver sup- ports with deposited isotope material; their modifica- tion should exclude physicochemical interaction (dif- fusion, alloying) of the material being activated and final radionuclides with the support material at elevated temperatures. One of possible solutions is preparation of the targets from inert high-melting materials. Special cyclotron supports were developed for ir- radiation of zinc targets in derived beams of domestic reactors (e.g., U-120 reactor of the St. Petersburg University). In this target, the material to be activated is deposited on a thin (750 (cid:5)m) tantalum support (24 mm in diameter); the (cid:6)loss(cid:7) in the thermal con- ductivity of tantalum as compared to silver and zinc is compensated by optimal combination of the strength and mechanical properties. Zinc metal is deposited by fusion in an inert atmosphere in a special cavity (14 mm in diameter) in the support center. In the course of irradiation, the excess heat is removed from   accelerators. In the course of irradiation of the en- riched 124Te target with protons with the initial energy of 15(cid:0)18 MeV (e.g., close to the energies of the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerator), the following reactions can proceed: 124Te(p, n)124I, Ethr 3.98 MeV, T1/2 4.18 days; 124Te(p, 2n)123I, Ethr 11.63 MeV, T1/2 13.19 h; 124Te(p, d)123mTe, Ethr 7.24 MeV, T1/2 119.7 days; 124Te(p, 3He)122Sb, Ethr 9.90 MeV, T1/2 2.7 days; 124Te(p, (cid:4)n)120mSb, Ethr 5.33 MeV, T1/2 5.76 days. The highest yields of transmutation radionuclides will be observed for reactions (p, n) and (p, 2n), i.e., the main radionuclide impurity in the final product will be 123I. The energy dependences of the yields of 123I and 124I [7] are given below.  8/0 9/0 10/0 11/0 12/0 13/0 14/0 15/0 16/0 18/0 Yield of 123I, MBq (cid:0)A(cid:4)1 h(cid:4)1 (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) 0.0121 0.184 0.854 2.58 5.55 17.0 Yield of 124I, MBq (cid:0)A(cid:4)1 h(cid:4)1 0.0056 0.0464 0.184 0.407 0.666 0.851 1.15 1.39 1.57 1.78 The optimal radionuclide purity of the target prod- uct for medical purposes should be no less than 99.5%, i.e., the content of 123I should be no more than 0.5%. In this case, the initial proton energy should not exceed 11.6 MeV. Under these conditions, the (p, 2n) reaction is completely prevented; the maximal yield of 124I is 0.5568 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1 at the proton energy of 11.6/8.0 MeV [7]. To decrease the amount of expensive initial starting material (124Te), the energy of the charged particles should be lower (11.6/8.6 MeV); in this case the loss of 124I would be no more than 3.4%. The data on the yields of the final product as influenced by the energy of charged particles and intensity of the proton beams are given below.

However, the data on the in- dustrial production of 124I at the Hammersmith Hos- pital (London, the United Kingdom) [3] showed that the absolute yields of 124I given in this handbook are underestimated by a factor of almost 3.5. For example, the yield of 124I at irradiation of the enriched tellurium target with 12.5-MeV protons is 2.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, and not 0.76 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, as given above. At the same time, the ratios of 124I and 123I are similar: only 2% of 123I is remains in the target after irradiation of the enriched tellurium (99.8%) target.

As compared to commonly used materials (Ag, Cu, Al, Pt), the loss in the thermal conductivity can be compensated by a decrease in the target thick- ness owing to higher strength properties of tantalum. The main aim of this part of the study was to deter- mine the process parameters of preparing 124I under the conditions of operation of the industrial target as- sembly of the COSTIS system (COmpact Solid Target Irradiation System) for the derived beam of the IBA Cyclone 18/9 accelerator. Main parameters of thermal processes in the course of irradiation of tellurium target on tan- talum support are given in Table 2. All further calculations were carried out taking into the data on the operation conditions and account geometric size of the target assembly of the COSTIS system (Fig. 3). In our calculations we used the following data: size of the support disc (24 mm in diameter, 2 mm thick), diameter of the effective irradiation area (12 mm), size of the inlet titanium foil (12 mm in diameter, 0.05 mm thick); temperature of the target assembly (15(cid:0)30(cid:8)C), helium flow rate (25 l min(cid:2)1), water flow rate (16 l min(cid:2)1), and water pressure (0.5 MPa). Since the tellurium target is cooled from the op- posite sides with water and helium, maximal tempera- tures are observed in the material bulk and not on the target surface. The coefficient of heat transfer at the tellurium(cid:0)helium boundary can be calculated only when the helium pressure is known (or set); it can be calculated taking into account the size of titanium window and the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 Calculations of the main characteristics of the helium heat exchanger. Helium heat exchanger is a diffuser(cid:0)confuser. Arrangement of the tellurium and titanium surfaces in the area of this unit strongly intensifies the heat exchange; the diffuser divergence (or confuser convergence) angles in the direction of titanium increase the coefficient of heat transfer at the helium(cid:0)titanium boundary, providing more efficient cooling. At a proton beam current of 15 (cid:5)A, the foil re- ceives 11.2 W and can be cooled by helium convec- tion (at a helium pressure PHe 30 mm Hg) if its mech- anical contact with the stainless-steel frame of the heat exchanger is efficient. With a decrease in the working pressure from 30 to 20 mm Hg, the temperature of the titanium foil de- creases from 136 to 112 (cid:8)C, and the conditional coef- ficient of the pressure reserve increases by a factor of almost 2. However, operation under such conditions is impossible because of the extremely high helium flow velocity (1306 m s(cid:2)1 at PHe < 25 mm Hg) exceeding the speed of sound ((cid:9)1060 m s(cid:2)1). Our calculations of the helium pressures in accor- dance with the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 [16] showed that the titanium foil can operate at a helium pressure of 30 mm Hg. The maximal working stresses are smaller than 100 MPa at a maximal tem- perature of the titanium window of 138(cid:8)C. With an in- crease in the helium pressure, the mechanical stresses linearly increase; the breaking stress decreases because of increasing temperature of the foil. Evaluation of the principal dimensions of the tantalum support and its strength; determination of the working temperatures of the support and tellurium target. The choice of the dimensions of the tantalum support reduces to evaluation of the thick- ness (STe) of the hollow bottom where tellurium is placed. In turn, STe determines some main character- istics of the target: voltage level, maximal flexure,     Fig. 3.

Our approximate strength calculations in accor- dance with PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 [16] showed that the tantalum bottom should be 279 (cid:5)m thick. Because importance of deformation characteristics, we of decided to equalize deflections along the axis of the COSTIS target and the suggested unit; as a result, STe was taken as 750 (cid:5)m. This decreases the heat transfer in a support in the radial directions by 30% in comparison with a platinum support of the same this decrease is not decisive. thickness. However, Our calculations of the stresses and deflections of the tantalum target as influenced by the pressure of cooling water and heat load (i.e., current of the charged particle beam) of the cyclotron target showed that the whole target cross section operates under the conditions of small compression stresses (from (cid:0)14 to (cid:0) 45 MPa), which is the best regime providing stable operation of the metal for more than 100 h at beam currents of up to 20 (cid:5)A.     Using the procedure for longitudinal flow along an impermeable plate [17, 18], we determined the coeffi- cients of heat transfer of tantalum in water of 98 000 (cid:0) 67 200 W m(cid:2)2 K(cid:2)1, decreasing in the direction from the center. Taking into account these coefficients, we found that the maximal temperature in the irradiated layer of elemental tellurium is lower than 545.6 K (272.6(cid:8)C). Thus, our calculations showed the principal suit- ability of the target of elemental tellurium deposited on a tantalum support; the most dangerous cross sec- tion of the support operates under the compression conditions, which allows the beam current to be in- creased to 20 (cid:5)A. To decrease the deflection of the tantalum support (i.e., to eliminate the possibility of exfoliation of elemental tellurium), its thickness can be increased to 1(cid:0)1.5 mm.    Because of weak interaction between the elements, formation of a strong tellurium coating directly on tantalum is impossible. Thus, it is necessary to make a thin intermediate layer providing sufficient diffusion junction of the composite without affecting the heat transfer. The material of this layer should be characterized by the intermediate (between Ta and Te) coefficients of linear thermal expansion, fairly high thermal con- ductivity (to provide satisfactory heat removal during irradiation), ability to form strong coatings on the tan- talum surface, high adhesion to tellurium to prepare strong coatings withstanding repeated cycles of irra- diation and thermal treatment of the targets, and absence of the volatile products of nuclear reactions proceeding in the course of proton irradiation. Metallic Ni is the most appropriate for this pur- pose: LCTEs of Ta, Ni, and Te (K(cid:2)1) are 6.79 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 (373(cid:0) 673 K), 13.2 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 (143(cid:0) 693 K), and 17.0 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 K(cid:2)1 (273(cid:0)373 K), respectively [6]; the heat con- ductivities of Ta, Ni, and Te (W m(cid:2)1 K(cid:2)1), 45.3(cid:0)53.6 (273(cid:0) 673 K), 67.0 (cid:0)71.4 (293(cid:0)500 K), and 1.8(cid:0)1.34 (350(cid:0)700 K), respectively [6]. High mutual solubility of Ta and Ni and Ni and Te [19] should provide the required diffusion junction of the elements and stabil- ity of the final three-layer composite in the repeated cycles of irradiation and thermal treatment. Irradiation of nickel with protons yields radionuclides of cobalt and copper, whose vapor pressure at 700 K is less than 1 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)16 atm [6]. The optimal procedure to prepare the intermediate layer of 3(cid:0)5 (cid:5)m thickness is electroplating, nickel which is widely used in mechanical engineering. Then, the layer of elemental tellurium can be depos- ited by fusion in an inert atmosphere.  the Sublimation Installation for Isolating 124I The radionuclide 124I can be isolated using a sub- limation installation with horizontal loading of the cyclotron target, equipped with an optical quartz separator and two furnaces.  In the horizontal chamber (40 mm internal diameter and 150 mm length) 124I is separated from irradiated elemental tellurium in the course of its melting. Under these conditions, the vapor pressure of Te is about 0.4 mm Hg, which is close to that of TeO2 at radio- chemical treatment of the commonly used targets [20]. Then the desired product is transported with a flow of heated inert carrier gas through a horizontal-vertical chamber (internal diameters of the horizontal and ver- tical sections of the chambers are 16 and 10 mm, respectively) to a trap with 0.01(cid:0) 0.02 M NaOH.      3.
