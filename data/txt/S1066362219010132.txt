 99Mo/99mTc Radioisotope Generator Based on Zirconium Selenomolybdate as Column Matrix  a Radioactive Isotopes Department, Hot Laboratories Center, Atomic Energy Authority, P.O. Box 13759, Cairo, Egypt b Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Damietta University, Damietta, Egypt   Abstract—Zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrices were prepared by mixing solutions of zirconium oxychlo- ride, selenous acid, and sodium molybdate in different manners. The elution of the generated 99mTc radioactiv- ity from the obtained zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrices was studied using small chromatographic col- umns of the matrix. 6 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix dried at 50°C, packed in a glass column (1.1 cm i.d.), was eluted by passing 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 and ambient temperature (~25°C). The 99mTc elution yield of 77.1% was obtained. Radionuclidic, radiochemical, and chemical purity of the eluate proved to be suitable for use in medical applications.   In nuclear medicine, 99mTc is the most frequently used radiotracer because of its suitable physical and nuclear properties. It emits monoenergetic (140 keV) γ-photon suitable for γ-cameras. In addition, its half- life of 6 h is suitable for performing the required tests without exposing the patient to unacceptable radiation dose. Planar cameras are used for bone scanning with 99mTc-MDP, and SPECT cameras are used for cardiac 99mTc-Sestamibi [1–7]. Cyclotron- scanning with produced 99mTc is not practical because of the high cost and short half-life [8–10]. The main source of 99mTc is the β–-decay (87.5%) of 99Mo (T1/2 = 65.94 h). Techne- tium-99m of high purity, suitable for medical applica- tions, is obtained by elution of radioisotope generators based on alumina columns loaded with fission 99Mo of high specific activity [11]. Other sorbents were also tested for preparing 99Mo/99mTc generators, such as silica gel, hydrous zirconium oxide, manganese diox- ide, and hydrous titanium oxide [12]. The main disad- vantage of these generators is the limited adsorption capacity of the base material for 99Mo, which, in turn, requires the use of 99Mo of very high specific activity (of the order of tens thousands Ci g–1), produced from nuclear reactors via fission route. Generation of high amounts of intermediate and long-lived fission product waste as a result of complex multistep separation and purification of fission 99Mo in expensive hot cells with sophisticated equipment and infrastructure are the  main disadvantages of fission 99Mo radioisotope gen- erators [13]. Alternative technologies are required to overcome these drawbacks. These alternative technolo- gies are based on incorporating neutron activation 99Mo of low and medium specific activity (0.3– 3.5 Ci g–1 Mo) into insoluble precipitates of high Mo content such as Ce, Zr, Mg, Ti, Fe, Th, Sn, and Te compounds, which are then used as column matrices [14–28]. Post- and pre-irradiation-formed gels are the two common techniques used for preparing gel genera- tors. Isotope exchange allows overcoming the radiation degradation resulting from irradiation of the prepared gel material and the multistep procedure in pre- and post-irradiation-formed gel techniques, respectively [16, 29]. Solvent extraction of 99mTcO4 – or sublimation of 99mTc2O7 has also been used in some generator sys- tems for extraction of 99mTc from 99Mo of relatively low specific activity, produced by direct neutron acti- vation of molybdenum targets [12]. This study was aimed at preparing 99Mo/99mTc gen- erator based on zirconium selenomolybdate as a col- umn matrix by post-irradiation-formed gel technique.  All chemicals used were of A. R. grade. Distilled water was used for preparing and washing the solutions.   Radiometric identification and measurements were made with a multichannel analyzer (MCA) of Inspec- tor 2000 model, Canberra series (the United States), coupled with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) coaxial detector of GX2518 model. A UV-160 A UV-VIS spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was used for deter- mining Zr and Mo. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with an 18 kV diffractometer (D8 Ad- vance, Bruker, the United States) with monochromated CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Elemental analysis was carried out with a BW-1200 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Philips, Netherlands). The morphology was examined with a JSM-6510A field emission scan- ning electron microscope (FESEM) (Japan). The IR spectrum was recorded with an MB157S FT-IR spec- trometer (Bomem, Canada) in the range from 4000 to 400 cm–1 at room temperature. Thermal analysis, in- cluding simultaneous thermal gravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal (DTA) analysis, was carried out with a DTG-60H device (Shimadzu, Japan). Radioactive 99Mo solution. 99Mo was obtained by eluting a 99Mo/99mTc generator with alumina-packed columns (Mon-Tek Generator, Monrol Nuclear Prod- ucts Industry and Trade, Turkey), loaded with 20 GBq on calibration date. Each column was eluted with a 2 M NH3 solution. The 99Mo eluate was passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter to retain any possi- ble alumina particles. The ammonium molybdate-99Mo solution was gently heated to dryness and then redis- solved in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Alternatively, for pre- paring 99Mo/99mTc generators, solutions of fission 99Mo (~100 mCi) in 0.1 M NaOH solution were obtained from the ETRR-II Radioisotope Production Facility (RPF). Then, 99Mo solution was diluted with 1.0 M HCl to the desired pH value. Preparation of zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrix. 0.25 M Mo(VI) solution was prepared by dis- solving 3.025 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O in a small portion of distilled water with the addition of 5 mL of a 99Mo solution along with a few drops of 30% H2O2. The re- sulting sodium molybdate solution was warmed to de- stroy excess H2O2 and then cooled to room tempera- ture before adjusting to pH about 4.5 with 2 M HNO3. The volume of the Mo(VI) solution was completed to 50 mL with distilled H2O. 0.25 M Zr(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 5.062 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O in a small portion of distilled water and then was com- pleted to 62.5 mL, after which it was heated to 60°C and then left to cool to room temperature (~25°C).  0.2 M Se(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 3.224 g of H2SeO3 in a small portion of distilled water and then was completed to 50 mL. Mixtures with dif- ferent Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios were pre- pared by dropwise addition of the Mo(VI) solution to the stirred Se(IV) solution, followed by dropwise addi- tion of the Zr(IV) solution. Varied volumes of the three solutions were used to obtain different molar ratios. The pH of the solution for preparing the ZSM gel was adjusted to ~5.0 with 2 M Na2CO3. The precipitates formed were digested in the mother solution for 24 h at room temperature before phase separation by centrifu- gation. After separation, the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water until the washing filtrates were free from chloride ions, dried at 50°C for 24 h, and pulverized to the desired particle size. The precipitation yield Y [% 99Mo in the form of Zr(IV) selenomolybdate gel] was radiometrically determined using the formula  where A0 and AF are the radioactivities of 99Mo in the initial mixed solution and supernatant after separating the precipitated ZSM gel, respectively, measured under identical geometric and counting conditions. Elution of 99mTc from 99Mo-99mTc chroma- tographic columns. Unless otherwise stated, small chromatographic columns consisting of glass burettes of different internal diameter and containing different amounts of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix were used. The columns were conditioned for 99mTc elution by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solutions through the bed matrix and left for 24 h before elution. The columns were eluted 10 times with different flow rates (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mL min–1) over the course of 15 days (shelf life). The time between each two successive elution runs was 23 h. The 99mTc elu- tion yield was determined by comparing the counting rates of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum of the column directly before and after elution, taking the contribution of 99Mo to this peak into account [15]. The elution profiles were drawn for various elution flow rates. pH values of the eluate solutions were de- termined with a pH meter. The effect of the bed size was studied using chro- matographic columns (0.6 cm i.d.) packed with 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo ma- trix. Alternatively, equal amounts of the zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel (1.0 g each) were packed in     Sample no.

For dry elution studies, a stream of air was passed through the molybdate bed to keep it free from the in- terstitial saline solution for the next elution. Preparation of 99mTc generator based on zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel matrix. A glass col- umn (1.1 cm i.d.) was packed with 6 g of the zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel. The generator was conditioned for elution of 99mTc by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution through the column bed and then left overnight to be ready for the elution of the gener- ated 99mTc radionuclide. The 99Mo content in the eluate (99Mo breakthrough) was determined, in the case of its presence, as the con- tribution of the count rate of 181 or 739 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum to the total count rate. The γ-ray spectrum of the eluate was measured directly after elu- tion and after 3 days. The radionuclidic purity of the eluted 99mTc was determined as the contribution of the count rate of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum. The radiochemical purity defined as the percentage of 99mTc radioactivity present in the 99mTcO4 – form was determined by ascending paper chromatography using Whatman no. 1 chromatographic paper and 85% methanol as a developing solvent. The activity distri- bution along the chromatogram was determined with a γ-ray spectrometer, and Rf was calculated as the ratio of the distance (cm) traveled by 99mTc species from the starting line to the peak position to the distance (cm) traveled by the solvent from the starting line to the sol- vent front. The possible Zr, Mo, and Se impurities in 99mTc eluate were determined by ICP and/or UV-VIS spec- trometry. The zirconium selenomolybdate gel prepared under optimum conditions was characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TGA, DTA), XRD, XRF, and FESEM.  The chemical composition, particularly the Mo con- tent of the zirconium selenomolybdate gel, is a signifi- cant factor for its use as a column matrix in preparation of gel-type 99Mo/99mTc radioisotope generators. The chemical composition of the obtained zirconium se- lenomolybdate materials was studied radiometrically by dissolving the gel materials prepared from the ra- dioactive solution of 95Zr, 99Mo, and 75Se in a hot con- centrated HCl solution. The table compiles the data on the Mo(VI) precipitation yield, the corresponding equi- librium pH value, and some properties of the formed zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo products at the given Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios. As can be seen, the precipitation yield of Mo(VI) from the Mo(VI)– Se(IV)–Zr(IV) mixed solutions decreased with increas- ing Se concentration. The Mo content decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrices, ZSM-1 > ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. This means that the selectivity of the positively charged zirconia surface to molybdate and/ or selenite anionic species depends on their concentra- tion in the mixed solution. At low selenite concentra- tions, the molybdate anions show higher affinity for the positively charged zirconia surface than the se- 2– anions appreciably con- lenite anions do. The SeO3 tribute to the ZSM structure at low Mo(VI) content to keep the zirconia surface neutral. The relative content of Zr(IV) in the gel matrices decreased as the initial concentration of Se(IV) in the mixed solutions in- creased: ZSM-1> ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. In addition, the weight loss of the precipitates dried at 150 and 200°C to constant weight decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrix. Therefore, ZSM-1 sample of zirconium selenomolybdate was chosen for characteri- zation (via IR, thermal analysis, XRD, and FESEM) and further preparation and quality control of 99Mo/99mTc generator. The suggested formula of the formed gel matrices may be written as ZrO(OH)+· (HSeO3)1–x(HMoO4)x·nH2O [21].        gel matrix (ZSM-1) shows the presence of extra water molecules in addition to –OH groups and metal oxides present in the material (Fig. 1). The bands observed at 878 and 722 cm–1 may be due to metal–oxygen bonds, which are manifested in the range 650–1000 cm–1. The band at 1380 cm–1 belongs to bending vibrations of metal-bonded hydroxyl groups. The strong and sharp peak at 1617 cm–1 may be due to HOH bending vibra- tion. The absorption bands at 2900 and 3421 cm–1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of coordinated wa- ter [30, 31]. Figure 2 shows the TG and DTA curves of the zir- conium selenomolybdate gel. The first step in the TG curve between 40–200°C with the weight loss of 11.58% corresponds to the loss of physically adsorbed water and water of crystallization with an endothermic peak in the DTA curve at 125°C. The weight loss in the range 200–440°C was small (2.6%). An endother- mic peak observed at 500.6°C with the weight loss of 11.165% in the range 435–530°C can be assigned to the evaporation of SeO2 and coordinated water and to decomposition of hydroxyl groups. The weight loss in the range 600–900°C was 4.51%. The presence of suit- able amounts of water in the gel material is important to enhance the 99mTc diffusion through the gel material during the elution [32]. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dried zirconium selenomolybdate gel, which shows that it is amorphous. The amorphous structure is much better than the crystalline structure because of more efficient diffusion of the eluent through the amorphous material, increasing the elution yield. The SEM images of the prepared ZSM material at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the gel matrix has a porous basic structure, which makes it good material for diffusion of 99mTc during elution [33].    Elution of 99mTc. Figure 5 shows how the internal diameter of the column and the amount of the matrix influence the 99mTc elution profile. As can be seen, large size of the bed matrix is the major factor influ- encing the 99mTc elution performance. The position of the maximum elution is displaced to higher eluate vol- umes with increasing inside diameter of the column (0.46, 0.6, and 1.1 cm i.d.), i.e., with decreasing height of the zirconium selenomolybdate bed. About 97, 86.2, and 69.9% of the eluted 99mTc radioactivity was eluted with the first 3 mL. The elution yield was found to be 83.3, 81.7, and 76.8% for 0.46, 0.6, and 1.1 cm inside diameter, respectively. The elution profiles of 99mTc from the 1.1 cm i.d. column containing different amounts of the molybdate matrix (1, 3, and 6 g) are shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the position of the maximum elution remains unchanged (3 mL) with in-    Fig. 8. γ-Ray spectra of (a) ZSM column (1.1 cm i.d.) loaded with 99Mo, (b) 99mTc eluate measured immediately after elution, and (c) 99mTc eluate measured 7 days after elution. with the first 4 mL. The elution yield was found to be 81.7, 79.2, and 77.1% for 1, 3 and 6 g, respectively. Figure 7 shows the elution profiles of 99mTc from 1 g of zirconium selenomolybdate (0.6 cm i.d.) with 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution at flow rates of 0.5, 1, and 2 mL min–1. The broad and tailed elution profiles with increasing flow rate may be attributed to slow sorption/desorption kinetics of 99mTc. The elution yield was found to be 82.2, 81.7, and 78.3% at flow rates of 0.5, 1, and 2 mL min–1, respectively. The same behav- ior was reported for the elution of 99mTc from cerium molybdate gel matrix. 99Mo/99mTc radioisotope generator. The above data on the 99mTc(VII) elution under different condi- tions are promising for constructing a 99Mo/99mTc ra- dioisotope generator of the chromatographic column type, based on precipitated zirconium selenomolyb- date-99Mo. A glass column (1.1 cm i.d.) was packed with 6 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel, con- ditioned, and eluted with 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl solu- tion.  Fig. 5.

Figures 8a–8c show the γ-ray spectra of the column containing 6 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo (1.1 cm i.d.) and of 99mTc eluates immediately after elution and 7 days later, respectively. Only the 99mTc peak was detected in the eluates. The radionuclidic purity of the eluates was verified by γ-ray spectrometry and radioactive decay measurements using an NaI(Tl) scintillation counter. The half-life of ~6 h, correspond- ing to 99mTc, was obtained. As judged from the residual radioactivity belonging impurities to (Fig. 8c), the radionuclidic purity was ≥99.99%.  Figure 9 shows the radiochromatograms of 99mTc eluates obtained from 6 g of zirconium selenomolyb- date-99Mo with 0.9% NaCl at a flow rate 1 mL min–1. The peaks in the chromatograms were identified by γ-ray spectrometry and radioactive decay measure- ments. In all chromatograms, there was only one peak –. The radiochemical purity was at ~7 cm due to 99mTcO4 found to be 98.3%. This value complies with the rec- ommended specifications for 99mTc-labeled radiophar- maceuticals. The 99mTc eluates were chemically analyzed for the presence of Zr, Mo, and Se as chemically stable impu- rities from the zirconium selenomolybdate matrix. The Mo concentration in the eluates was found to be within 5 μg ml–1. Such Mo content of 99mTc eluates is below the permitted limit for medical applications.   1.
