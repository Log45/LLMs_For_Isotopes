It was found that MTOAC increases the distribution coeﬃ cients of both the extractant itself and its solvate with yttrium due to the formation of a mixed complex of yttrium and a dihydroxyaromatic ligand with MTOAC. During extraction from alkaline carbonate media in the pH range of 12–13.5 with mixtures of 0.01 M 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 0.015 M MTOAC in butyl acetate or toluene, the distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium exceed 80; the separation factors of the 90Y/90Sr pair under these conditions are more than 105. Dilute solutions of hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric acids can be used for the complete stripping of yttrium. The studied mixtures are chemically stable and do not change the extraction properties upon multiple extraction/stripping cycles. Model experiments on the leaching of yttrium from natural samples showed that the percentage of stable yttrium extraction from sand is 70–80%, while the percentage of yttrium extraction from soil is 50–60%.

Atmospheric nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility of 90Sr brings about its distribution in the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of living beings, where it concentrates in the bones and damages the surrounding tissues. The obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment is complicated by its nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the matrix material, exposure until equilibrium with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid– liquid extraction is widely used for the separation of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is eﬃ ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2]. But in both cases, a preliminary acid digesting of the samples is necessary, which involves the use of toxic and aggressive reagents. We proposed    a variant of yttrium separation from carbonate media using aromatic dihydroxy compounds as extractants [3]. This work is aimed at studying extraction of yttrium and its separation from strontium by synergistic mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with methyltrioctylammonium carbonate in carbonate-alkaline media. Mixtures of alkylammonium salts with organic acids, binary extractants, eﬃ ciently extract metals [4]. Phenolic groups are known to dissociate in alkaline media, and a similar eﬀ ect can be expected for mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with alkylammonium salts.  The following aromatic dihydroxy compounds were studied in the work: 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (2,3DHN), pyrocatechol (1,2DHB), alizarin, and 4-tert- butylpyrocatechol (4TBC).             4π, with an error not exceeding 10%. The concentration of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene in the aqueous phase was determined on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV spectrometer by absorbance at 237 nm. Aqueous media with diﬀ erent pH and constant ionic strength were prepared by mix- ing solutions of 1 M NaHCO3 and 1 M NaOH. The pH values of the solutions were determined using a Hanna Instruments HI-8314 pH meter with an I-1330B micro- electrode. The distribution coeﬃ cients (D), separation factors (SF), and the degree of extraction (E, %) were calculated using Eqs. (1)–(3)    C org 100,  C i where Ci, Corg, and Caq are the initial and equilibrium concentrations (activities) of metals or extractant in the organic and aqueous phases, respectively. All extraction experiments were carried out twice. The average values of the determined parameters were used.  1 2            9a 4a                     8a 4a     (MTOAC) was used as the alkylammonium salt synthesized at the Mendeleev University of Chemical Technologies of Russia according to the original method and provided by S.I. Stepanov. 2,3DHN was received from Schuhardt (Munich, Germany); 4TBC was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany); 1,2DHB and alizarin were manufactured by Lenreaktiv (Russia). Solvents, butyl acetate (BuAc), toluene (PhMe), inorganic salts and acids were produced by Ecos-1 (Russia). All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further solutions were prepared puriﬁ cation. Extractant according to their exact weighted portion. Extraction experiments were carried out as follows: 1 mL of the aqueous and organic phases were placed into a 5-mL polypropylene tube, stirred at 21 ± 1°C for 10 min (suﬃ cient to attain complete equilibrium ac- cording to the data of preliminary experiments), and the phases were separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 5 min). The concentration of stable strontium and yt- trium was determined on a Varian 725-ES optical emis- sion spectrometer with an error of no more than 5%. The activity of the 90Sr and 90Y isotopes in the initial solu- tion was found on a Quantulus 1220 liquid scintillation spectrometer (Perkin Elmer), measurement geometry         Model experiments with natural samples were conducted as follows. A sample of building sand was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and dried in an oven. After that, a sample of sand weighing 1 g was taken. A solution of stable yttrium nitrate was added to the sample in such an amount that its concentration in the ﬁ nal sample was 30 mg/L, everything was thoroughly mixed and dried in an oven, after which 3 g of Na2CO3 and K2CO3 were added to the sample. The resulting mixture was calcined in a muﬄ e for 1 h at 500°C. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the sample was placed in a polypropylene test tube, 50 mL of the leaching agent solution was added to the sample (5 leaching agents were tested in total—H2O/H2O2 (3 : 2), NaHCO3/H2O2, NH4HCO3/H2O2, and (NH4)2CO3/H2O2, (NH4)2CO3). For 2 h, a sample of sand was contacted at stirring with the aqueous phase to transfer yttrium carbonate into the aqueous phase. Then the aqueous phase was separated and sent for extraction with a mixture of 0.01 M 2.3DHN + 0.015 M MTOAC in toluene at a volume ratio of the organic and aqueous phases O : A = 1 : 1 and a contact time of 10 min. Afterwards, the phases were separated by centrifugation. Yttrium was stripped from the organic phase with a 0.05 M HNO3 solution at O : A = 5 : 1, after which the nitric acid aqueous solution was separated by centrifugation. The content of stable yttrium was measured therein by the spectrophotometric method. A soil sample (500 g), taken in a forest belt on the territory of the Leningrad Region, was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and mixed with a radioactive label containing a 90Y/90Sr pair being in radioactive equilibrium with a total activity of 530 Bq (the speciﬁ c activity of the soil was about 1 Bq/g ). A soil sample labelled with 90Y/90Sr was dried in an oven, after which a sample (2 g) was taken. Solutions of stable yttrium and strontium nitrates in the molar ratio Y : Sr = 10 : 1 were added to the sample, everything was thoroughly stirred and dried in an oven; then 10 g of Na2CO3 and K2CO3 were added to the sample. The resulting mixture was calcined in a muﬄ e for 1 h at a temperature of 300°С, and then for another 4 h at a temperature of 550°С. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the sample was placed in a polypropylene test tube, and 50 mL of distilled water was added. The sample was contacted for 2 h at stirring with water to transfer yttrium carbonate into the aqueous phase. Then the aqueous phase was  separated. Yttrium was extracted from it with a mixture of 0.01 M 2.3DHN + 0.015 M MTOAC in toluene according to the standard procedure at O : A = 1 : 1 and a contact time of 10 min. Afterwards, the phases were separated by centrifugation. Yttrium was stripped from the organic phase with a 0.05 M HNO3 solution at O : A = 4 : 1, then the nitric acid aqueous solution was separated by centrifugation. The content of stable yttrium was measured by the spectrophotometric method and the content of yttrium-90 by the radiometric method on a Teﬂ on target using an A-85 radiometer with a plastic scintillator (the counting eﬃ ciency was 25%, the measurement error at the selected exposure time was no higher than 5%). The percentage of yttrium-90 extraction from the soil was calculated based on the measurement results.  Preliminary experiments showed that all the studied aromatic dihydroxy compounds weakly extract yttrium from alkaline media. The low extraction eﬃ ciency may be due to the washing out of the extractant into the aqueous phase because of the formation of hydrophilic sodium phenolates. According to the literature data [5], 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene has pKa1 = 8.8, pKa2 = 12.6, which indicates its complete transition to the monosodium salt in highly alkaline media. The MTOAC cation generates hydrophobic salts with the phenolate anion and helps to reduce the loss of the extractant with the aqueous phase. Figure 1 shows data on the distribution of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and its salt with MTOAC between the organic and aqueous phases. From the data in Fig. 1, it can be seen that at pH below 11, the addition of MTOAC does not signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ect the distribution of 2,3DHN between the aqueous and organic phases. At pH 13.5, the transition of 2,3DHN from butyl acetate into the aqueous phase decreases from 75 to 3.2% in the presence of MTOAC. Obviously, during the yttrium extraction in a strongly alkaline medium, the anionic complex of 2,3DHN with the metal interacts with the MTOAC cation and passes into the organic phase. It should be noted that the yttrium extraction with dihydroxy compounds sharply increases at pH of aqueous solutions above 11 (see below).

It can be seen that a 1.5- fold excess of MTOAC with respect to 2,3DHN is optimal, which suggests the formation of a solvate of the composition [Y(2,3DHN)2(MTOAC)3] [6]. The existence of a complex of this composition is conﬁ rmed by the MS-ESI(–) data: in addition to the 2,3DHN monoanion (m/z = 159.0448), there is a signal with m/z = 404.8723 of the [Y(2,3DHN)2]– monoanion. The MS- ESI(–) spectra contain signals from anionic complexes, which, in addition to yttrium and 2,3DHN, include carbonate and hydroxyl groups and water molecules. Compared to pure 2,3DHN and MTOAC, their synergistic mixture extracts yttrium with distribution coeﬃ cients approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher: for 0.005 M MTOAC in PhMe, DY = 0.47, for 0.005 М 2,3DHN DY = 2.5 × 10–5, and for their mixture DY = 32 (Fig. 2). As already noted, the maximum extraction of yttrium by mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with MTOAC is detected at pH above 11. We found that the speciﬁ c form of distribution coeﬃ cient curve for yttrium vs. pH of the aqueous phase is determined by the type of dihydroxy compound and the type of organic solvent (Fig. 3). The most eﬀ ective extractant in both solvents is 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. The lowest distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium, regardless of the type of solvent, are demonstrated by 4-tert-butylpyrocatechol. Its unsubstituted analog, pyrocatechol, extracts yttrium well only into toluene solutions. This may be due to steric factors, since the properties of phenolic groups in these extractants are very similar. High distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium were found in a water-soluble chelating agent, alizarin, giving a hydrophobic complex with MTOAC, which is concentrated in the organic phase. A solution of alizarin in butyl acetate upon contact with an aqueous phase with a pH below 12.5 forms a third phase. The possibility of eﬃ cient separation of yttrium and strontium was demonstrated by the example of 2,3DHN, the most eﬃ cient of the studied extractants (Fig. 4). The data in Fig. 4 show that at pH > 12, Y/Sr pair separation factors exceed 105 in both toluene and butyl acetate. Such a high selectivity is unattainable in the extraction of strontium with crown ethers [1] or yttrium with alkyl phosphoric acids [2] from nitric acid solutions. Small diﬀ erences in the behavior of stable and radioactive isotopes are most likely associated with a high error in determining the low activities of 90Sr and 90Y in saline solutions. An additional advantage of the studied extraction systems is the simplicity of yttrium stripping with dilute acid solutions. For the quantitative stripping of yttrium, one contact of the extract with 0.05 M solutions    2,3DHN 2,3DHN-MTOAC      Fig. 3.

The extractant after stripping of yttrium with acids retains its properties. Figure 5 shows the results of experiments on multiple extraction/stripping of yttrium using a mixture of 0.01 M 2,3DHN with 0.015 M MTOAC in toluene as an extractant and 0.05 M HNO3, HCl, and H2SO4 solutions as strips. It can be seen that a slight decrease in the extraction capacity after 4 extraction/stripping cycles is observed only in the case of using sulfuric acid (Fig. 5). Experiments on the leaching of yttrium from sand were carried out with leaching solutions of ﬁ ve diﬀ erent compositions. The percentage of extraction separation of yttrium from sand after carbonate sintering, leaching  2,3DHN Alazarin 1,2DHB 4 TBC 2,3DHN Alazarin 1,2DHB 4 TBC and extraction of yttrium into the organic phase is shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from the data in Fig. 6, in all the systems studied, there is a high percentage of yttrium extraction (70–80%), therewith aqueous phases consisting of ammonium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate with the addition of hydrogen peroxide proved to be more eﬀ ective. The introduction of hydrogen peroxide into the leaching solution was proposed for further oxidizing possible organic residues. Table 1 presents data on carbonate penetration and separation of yttrium from a soil sample containing the 90Y/90Sr radioactive label and stable yttrium with strontium. Based on the measurement results, the percentage of 90Y extraction from the soil was calculated (ﬁ nal value after all operations). The data obtained show that leaching from a soil sample is less eﬃ cient than from pure sand, which may be due to the high content of mineral acid salts in the soil, which pass into the aqueous phase during leaching and interfere with the complete extraction of yttrium, as well to the possibility of mechanical retention of yttrium by microdispersed particles.  Recovery of 90Y and its separation from 90Sr are eﬀ ectively carried out in carbonate media using synergistic extraction mixtures of aromatic dihydroxy compounds with methyltrioctylammonium carbonate. In the presence of MTOAC, the distribution coeﬃ cients of both the extractant itself and its solvate with yttrium increase. In alkaline carbonate media with pH 12–13.5, mixtures of 0.01 M 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 0.015 M MTOAC in toluene and butyl acetate extract yttrium with distribution coeﬃ cients of more than 80 and 90Y/90Sr separation factors of more than 105. Yttrium is easily stripped with dilute inorganic acids.

The studies were carried out using the equipment of the resource centre of St. Petersburg State University “Chemical analysis and Material Research Centre” and the resource centre of St. Petersburg State University “Magnetic resonance research centre.”         2.
