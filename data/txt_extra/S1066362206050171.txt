E. Alekseev and V. V. Lazarev  Received June 10, 2005 Abstract(cid:0)The reaction cross sections and the energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deuteron energies (<14 MeV) were determined. The specific features of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets were studied in relation to the gas medium composition. The yield of the desired product increases with an increase in the oxygen content in the course of heat treatment of the targets. A simple (cid:0)dry(cid:2) procedure was developed for isolation of 186Re with a yield no less than 85% and radiochemical purity no worse than 99.99%. A proto- type of a cyclotron target for commercial production of the therapeutical radionuclide 186Re was suggested. PACS numbers: 25.45.-z DOI: 10.1134/S1066362206050171 Radioactive isotopes and ionizing radiation sources are widely used in science, industry, engineering, and medicine. In the past two decades, two major trends were steadily observed on the world market of radio- isotopes: decline in the use of fissile radioactive mate- rials and increase in the production of radionuclides for nuclear medicine [1]. Radionuclide therapy is an actively developing field of nuclear medicine. It has doubtless advantages over other kinds of radiation therapy because of low side effects, minimal damage of normal tissues, and possibility of treating metastases and disseminated tumors. Presently the annual volume of sells of radionu- clides for medicine and of radiopharmaceuticals in the United States (45% of the world market in this field) is about $700 mln. American marketing companies expect that by 2015 the annual volume of sells of radionuclides for medicine will increase to $4.5 bln, primarily due to increased production of therapeutical radioisotopes [1]. In the past 3(cid:0) 4 years, the efforts of the leading research laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL, etc.) are focused on the development of processes for production of certain radionuclides (47Sc, 89Sr, 131I, 153Sm, 186Re, 188Re, 213Bi, 211At), among which 186Re occupies a prominent place. The following factors are responsible for the increased interest  This is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 3.78 days) (cid:0) -decay with an (cid:3)impurity(cid:4) of electron undergoing (cid:2) capture (7.47%) [2]. Short path length of the electrons (their maximal energy is 359.2 keV) in living tissues allows destruction of tumors up to 1 mm in diameter. The intrinsic (cid:5)-radiation of the radionuclide (the ener- gy of its main transition, 137.2 keV with an intensity of 9.47%, is approximately the same as that of 99mTc widely used in SPECT, 140.5 keV) is well detected with a commercial scintillation (cid:5)-ray camera and allows efficient monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body. The main goals of this study are as follows: deter- mination of the reaction cross sections and energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deu- teron energies (<14 MeV); study of the specific fea- tures of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets in relation to the gas medium composition; development of a diffusion-thermal procedure for isolating 186Re; mastering of procedures for preparing cyclotron tar- gets from isotopically enriched (186W) powder materi- als; and preliminary radiation and materials-science studies of the new types of the targets.  Determination of the reaction cross sections and energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deuteron energies (<14 MeV). Cyclotron tar-    gets were prepared from pieces of 20-(cid:6)m foil (surface (cid:0)2) of W metal of natural isotope density 38.6 mg cm composition (chemical purity 99.95%) and from pow- ders of isotopically enriched 186W (99.78% enrich- ment) or of naturally abundant W (chemical purity no less than 99.91%).   The energy dependences of the reaction cross section and yield of 186Re in the energy range 12.84/5.85 MeV (energy threshold of the reaction 3.58 MeV) were measured using foil stacks. To determine the integral deuteron beam current, (cid:0)2, we used iron monitors (surface density 16.5 mg cm chemical purity no less than 99.9%) which were ar- ranged along the deuteron beam before and after the tungsten samples [4]. Radiation materials-science studies of cyclotron targets based on isotopically enriched powdered 186W. Preliminary radiation materials-science tests of cyclotron targets were performed on a U-120 cyclo- tron using deuteron beams (initial energy 13 MeV) of various intensities (maximal beam current 8 (cid:6)A, beam power up to 40 W). The cyclotron targets were W/C composites com- pacted under a pressure of 340 (cid:0)370 atm. Graphite was added as an inert weakly activated (its proton or deuteron irradiation yields only ultra-short-lived radio- nuclides 11C, 13N) binder having high thermal con- ductivity. The W/C ratio was varied from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1; the surface density with respect to natW was 290 (cid:0) (cid:0)3. 300 mg cm The intergal deuteron beam current was also deter-   Radioisotope composition of irradiated targets and beam monitors was determined by precision (cid:5)-ray spectrometry (GX1018 semiconductor HPGe detector). To calibrate the spectrometer scale with respect to energy and determine the efficiency of (cid:5)-radiation detection in the energy range 0.120 (cid:0) 1.500 MeV, we used a 152Eu reference source (45 kBq) from an OSGI kit.  the forming radionuclides was determined from the following photopeaks (MeV; in parentheses, intensity, %) [2]: 56Co (beam monitor) 0.8468 (99.93), 1.2383 (66.95); 65Zn (beam monitor) 1.1155 (50.74); 186Re 0.1372 (9.47). The activity of radionuclides in the targets and beam monitors after the irradiation was measured with an accuracy of 2%. Specific features of physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclo- tron targets; development of a procedure for iso- lating the desired product. We studied the emana- tion of impurity 186Re atoms from irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets (these experiments were performed with powders of both enriched 186W and naturally abundant W) in relation to the gas medium composi- tion. Samples were annealed at 530 (cid:0)1200 K in a vac- (cid:0)2 torr) (cid:0)5(cid:0)10 uum (residual presure 10 or in air (in the latter case, the irradiated tungsten was mixed with a powder of spectrally pure graphite).   The optimal annealing time, 3600 s, was chosen the results of previous experi- taking into account ments with the generator couple 188W/188Re. The 186Re egress from the metal was determined from the ratio of the counting rates of the samples before and after etching, using the photopeak at 0.1372 MeV. The possible loss of W metal during annealing of the foils was determined using similar comparative (cid:5)-ray spectrometric measurements of the intensities of the photopeaks at 0.6858 (intensity 31.6%) and 0.4795 MeV (25.3%) of 187W formed by the reaction 186W(d, p)187W, reaction threshold 0 MeV.  Determination of the reaction cross sections and energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deuteron energies (<14 MeV). The energy dependence of the 186Re yield (recalculated to the end of irradiation) is given below.  12.84/11.86 11.86/10.82 10.82/9.71 9.71/8.53 8.53/7.26 7.26/5.85 0.917 0.874 0.726 0.447 0.175 0.033 From these data, we calculated the energy depen- dence of the cross section of the 186Re formation in the examined range of deuteron energies. The results are shown in the figure together with certain published data [5, 6]. The integral yield of 186Re in the energy range (cid:0)1, which is in  12.84/5.85 MeV was 3.17 MBq (cid:6)A good agreement with published data [5(cid:0)9].     With enriched W samples, the yield of the desired (cid:0)1; with product can be increased to 11.1 MBq (cid:6)A 99.78%-enriched 186W, we measured the 186Re yield in the energy range 12.8/10.8 MeV. The yield of the (cid:0)1, which is desired product was 6.29 MBq (cid:6)A fully consistent with the results of previous studies made with foil stacks.   Specific features of physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclo- tron targets; procedures for isolating the desired product. In some systems (e.g., Mo:99mTc, Sn:113mIn, W:188Re), a polymorphous transition is accompanied not only by accelerated diffusion associated with the radiation damage of the metal upon irradiation, but also by emanation into the gas phase of impurity atoms that diffused to the metal surface [10 (cid:0)13]. Below we give as example data on the emanation of 113mIn from Sn metal to the gas phase above the point of the polymorphous transition of the metal from tetragonal to hexagonal modification (Sn, (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:5), 446 K) [11, 12]. Annealing tempera- ture, K, (cid:4)2 Release into gas phase, %           The discovered phenomenon formally resembles the classical emanation of inert gases from crystalline salts [14] and release of volatile fission products from UO2 [15]. It should be emphasized that such processes are observed only in systems with polymorphism. In par- in the Sn:113mIn system the release of the ticular, 113mIn atoms into the gas phase starts in the tempera- ture range of the (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:5) polymorphous transition (from 453 K), and in the Cd:111In system no (cid:3)volatili- zation(cid:4) of impurities is observed even at temperatures (575(cid:0)585 K) [16]. approaching the melting point Studies of the emanation in the Sn:113mIn system also showed that the release of the impurity atoms into the gas phase depends on the nuclear and physicochemical history of the sample, conditions of foil annealing, and composition of the gas medium [10, 11]. As in the case of the Sn:113mIn system, in the W:186Re system we also observed the release of daughter atoms into the gas phase, taking place only in a combination with a polymorphous transition. An- nealing of the irradiated metal at temperatures below the phase transition point (<1000 K) was not accom- panied by the egress of 186Re from the bulk of the metal (these experiments were performed only with   Cross section of the 186W(d, 2n)186Re reaction as a func- tion of deuteron energy: (1) this study, (2) data of [5], and (3) data of [6]. irradiated W powders, because a polymorphous transi- tion in W was discovered only in finely dispersed samples [17]). Heating of irradiated W above the polymorphous transition point (>1000 K) was accompanied by the release of 186Re into the gas phase; the release of the impurity atoms from the bulk of the metal became more active with an increase in the oxygen content in the medium in the course of heat treatment of the targets. In particular, when the irradiated cyclotron (cid:0)4 torr, the release of (cid:0)5(cid:0)10 targets were annealed at 10 (cid:0)2 torr it did not (cid:0)3(cid:0)10 186Re did not exceed 3%, at 10 exceed 15%, and when the samples (W/C composites) were heated in air, the release increased to 65% (typi- cal value for the majority of our experiments). This fact strongly suggests that, along with the emanation occurring at polymorphous transitions, there is some other process facilitating the release of radioactive microimpurities (in the form of volatile rhenium species ReO3, Re2O7) into the gas phase, e.g., their release in the course of cyclic gas transport reactions of the following type: oxidation of irradiated W metal with atmospheric oxygen (cid:7) sublimation of WO3 with the release of impurity 186Re atoms into the gas phase (cid:7) condensation of WO3 on graphite powder followed by its reduction to metal (cid:7) reoxidation of W metal, etc. We took this separation scheme as a basis for a (cid:3)dry(cid:4) process for 186Re production. Further experi- ments showed that the yield of the desired product can be increased to 85%, with its radiochemical purity being no worse than 99.99%. Radiation materials-science studies of cyclotron targets based on isotopically enriched powdered 186W. In view of the above facts, it seemed appropri- ate to take pressed 186W/C composites as cyclotron targets for preparing 186Re. Radiation tests of such targets in charged particle beams with a power of up to 40 W (at mean deuteron   beam currents of 4 (cid:0)8 (cid:6)A) confirmed that these targets can be used as prototypes of cyclotron targets for commercial production of the therapeutical radionu- clide 186Re.
