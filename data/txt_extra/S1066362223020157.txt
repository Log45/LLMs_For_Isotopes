 Separation of Boron Isotopes in Extraction Systems Tetraﬂ uoroboric Acid–Organophosphorus Compounds  а Khlopin Radium Institute, St. Petersburg, 194021 Russia b St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, 199034 Russia *e-mail: taisiia.maltseva@gmail.com  Abstract—Extraction systems based on extraction of tetraﬂ uoroboric acid (HBF4) with tributyl phosphate (TBP) and triamylphosphine oxide (TAPO) for boron isotope separation were studied. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid was studied in comparison with boric acid (H3BO3). The extraction isotherms at 20°C for four systems (boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids extracted with TBP and TAPO in o-xylene) were obtained, and single-stage isotope separation factors for these four systems were determined. The lighter boron isotope (10B) is concentrated in the aqueous phase in the systems containing tetraﬂ uoroboric acid, whereas in the systems with boric acid it is concentrated in the organic phase.

In such process, the enrichment factor α reaches 1.030 [2].  liquid extraction. Extraction of boric acid was studied in some recent works [3, 4], but no studies were performed with tetraﬂ uoroboric acid.  Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) such as trialkyl phosphates and trialkylphosphine oxides can be used as extractants. Trialkyl phosphates are well known as eﬀ ective extractants and are used for recovering many acids and salts, whereas trialkylphosphine oxides have been studied in this respect to a lesser extent, and their extracting and separating power is of large interest. To reach the maximum eﬃ cient isotope separation by liquid extraction in a multistep process, the substance distribution ratio should be as close to 1 as possible. The distribution ratio D is described by the equation        where Corg in the organic phase, and Caq phase. * is the equilibrium substance concentration * is that in the aqueous  Vigorous progress of such ﬁ elds as nuclear power engineering, medicine, and instrument making makes it necessary to develop and produce specialty materials enriched in certain isotopes of various chemical elements. In particular, the boron isotope 10В, which has high cross section of thermal neutron capture, is a valuable constituent of many materials. For example, materials based on 10B are demanded in nuclear power engineering, namely, in reactor control and protection systems and in production of steel for transportation racks and containers for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Boron-10 is used in neutron capture therapy for cancer treatment. High demand for materials enriched in 10B and insuﬃ cient scale of their production make it topical to search for, study, and develop more eﬃ cient and environmentally safe procedures for boron isotope separation. Methods based on chemical isotope exchange, when isotope eﬀ ects inﬂ uence the properties of complexes of the extractive compound and extractant, are candidate separation methods. The “anisole process” is the most known and eﬃ cient among such methods. It is based on the reaction of gaseous BF3 with anisole CH3ОC6H5 to form the complex CH3ОC6H5∙BF3(l). This complex   phases were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) with a PlasmaQuant PQ9000 device at the Khlopin Radium Institute. Isotope analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with an Agilent 7900 device.    isotope composition were prepared by dilution of the initial solutions of boron-containing components (boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids) to a boron concentration of 1–5 mg/L. In the case of tetraﬂ uoroboric acid, it was subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of CaCl2 to remove ﬂ uoride ions interfering with the analysis. As organic diluent for the extractants we chose o-xylene, because this diluent prevents the third phase formation in extraction systems and favors fast phase separation, in contrast to aliphatic diluents such as dodecane. Prior to use, o-xylene was washed four times with equivalent amounts of distilled water. Chemically pure grade boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids were used without additional puriﬁ cation. Tartaric acid was recrystallized from water and dried; the melting point after the puriﬁ cation was 167°С. Tributyl phosphate was puriﬁ ed as described in [7]. Triamylphosphine oxide (TAPO) chosen among trialkylphosphine oxides was puriﬁ ed as described in [8].            the H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TBP, H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TAPO, HBF4–TBP, and HBF4–TAPO systems (organic diluent: o-xylene) at 20°С are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.  We determined the distribution ratios for each extraction system. The highest distribution ratio D is reached in the HBF4–TAPO system: 1.5 at low acid concentrations. High distribution ratio D is an advantage in commercial separation of boron isotopes, because at one extraction step the larger fraction of the substance is extracted, and thus the amount of the enriched product obtained increases.   Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly inﬂ uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetraﬂ uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances. Boric acid as a weak acid cannot be eﬃ ciently extracted into the organic phase without additional complexation; therefore, tartaric acid is added to aqueous boric acid solutions. Tartaric acid converts boric acid into a complex that is a stronger acid interacting with the extractant more eﬃ ciently. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid does not require such additives. It is interesting to consider organophosphorus compounds as extractants. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is one of the most readily available and widely used commercial extractants. Along with TBP, mixed trialkylphosphine oxide Cyanex 923 is used for the recovery of metal ions. Despite their wide use for the extraction of metal cations, there are few data on extraction of boron-containing acids with them. Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) were studied as extractants for acids structurally similar to HBF4, i.e., for monobasic complex metal-containing acids HMHal4, where М is a metal and Hal is a halogen. The data presented in review [5] show that compounds of metals in oxidation state (III) (such as Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III)) are extracted in the organic phase to form ion pairs consisting of solvated proton and metal-containing anion. HBF4 can be assumed to be extracted by OPCs by a similar mechanism. Mishra et al. [6] report the results of the extraction of HFeCl4 with tributyl phosphate (D = 3–8) and mixed trialkylphosphine oxides Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 (D = 2–8). Khoroshilov and Ivanov [4] studied the boric acid– TBP extraction system in the context of separation of boron isotopes. They obtained the single-stage isotope separation factor α = 1.0067 ± 0.0035 at 20–22°С. In this system, 10В was concentrated in the organic phase.  When recording the extraction isotherms of H3BO3 and HBF4, the boron concentrations in the equilibrium       also an advantage for the extraction, because it increases the distribution ratio in the system. We determined the single-stage isotope separation factors α for the four extraction systems. The isotope separation in the systems with H3BO3 is not so high, which may be due to a signiﬁ cant change in pH of the aqueous phase upon ﬁ rst contact and cessation of isotope separation in the second and further extractions. On the other hand, the enrichment in the systems with HBF4 is higher than in the systems with H3BO3.    the H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TBP system can be compared to the data for the related system obtained in [4] (Table 1). The values coincide within the uncertainty.    Variation of the extractants inﬂ uences the isotope separation not so strongly as the kind of the extractable substance does. The isotope separation factors in the HBF4-TBP and HBF4–TAPO systems are close and coincide within the uncertainty. The kind of the extractant inﬂ uences to a greater extent the degree of extraction of the acid from the aqueous phase into the organic phase than the isotope eﬀ ects. Studies of extraction isotherms have shown that the HBF4–TAPO system gives the highest distribution ratio despite the 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 n* aq ((cid:572)), mM Fig. 1.

The extraction mechanism in each system was determined from the shape of the extraction isotherm. In the H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TBP, H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TAPO, and HBF4–TBP systems, the substance distribution is mainly physical. In the HBF4–TAPO system, the extraction occurs by the chemical mechanism with the chemical interaction between HBF4 and TAPO.

Thus, the use of TAPO as an extractant is more advantageous from the viewpoint of the reagent consumption. As we found, in the extraction of HBF4, 10B is accumulated in the aqueous phase in contrast to the systems with H3BO3, in which 10B is concentrated in the organic phase. Thus, it can be concluded that, among all the systems under consideration, the HBF4–TAPO is the most suitable system for the boron isotope separation by liquid extraction, because this system is characterized by the highest distribution ratio D, the most eﬃ cient reagent consumption, and relatively eﬃ cient isotope separation at a single stage.
