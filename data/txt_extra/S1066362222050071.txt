Sorption was carried out from a solution of 0.1 M HNO3, followed by elution with a solution of the ammonium salt of α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (hereinafter α-HIBA) with pH 5.0. The α-HIBA ammonium salt concentration was varied within 0.1–0.2 M. The best results were achieved with successive elution with α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.15 M. The characteristics of the developed chromatographic process of cation exchange puriﬁ cation of Cm using an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution as an eluent were determined: the number of theoretical plates N, distribution coeﬃ cient D, selectivity (separation factor) α, and resolution RS. Keywords: curium-248, americium-243, chromatography, ion exchange, elution, α-HIBA ammonium salt, puri- cation factor ﬁ   The synthesis and study of the properties of superheavy elements (SHE) is one of the fundamental areas of modern nuclear physics. Research in this area is being actively carried out both in Russia and in nuclear centers of other countries (Germany, Japan, USA). Thanks to the work performed at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (Dubna) and RIAR, nuclear- physical properties of new elements with serial numbers 115, 116, and 118 were synthesized and examined. These nuclides were prepared by irradiating targets based on highly enriched isotopes 243Am, 248Cm and 249Cf with 48Ca ions. Target materials are subject to high requirements for purity, as well as the content of radioactive impurities, which include Pu, Am, Cm, Cf isotopes and ﬁ ssion products. RIAR has an active production of 243Am and 248Cm radioactive materials [1]. Americium-243 is recovered from irradiated Pu by separation and precipitation methods [2, 3]. Curium-248 is recovered from aged 252Cf by extraction chromatography using HDEHP-based sorbents. As a rule, trace amounts  of impurities, including Cf and Pu isotopes, ﬁ ssion products, and corrosion products of construction substances (stainless steel), remain in the materials after standard puriﬁ cation methods. For preparing materials of pure transplutonium ele- ments (TPE), ion exchange is widely used in radiochem- ical practice. In ion exchange chromatography, the sepa- ration is based on the selectivity of the ion exchange resin with respect to the counterions of the mixture. When separating ions with very similar properties [for example, rare earth elements (REE)], most ion exchange resins exhibit almost the same aﬃ nity relative to ions close to each other. Separation of rare-earth elements by elution from a column containing a cation exchange resin with a solution of a strong, non-chelating acid is practically impossible, since their distribution coeﬃ - cients diﬀ er little from each other [4]. If you choose a chelating agent that, with the ions of the mixture gives complex compounds of various strengths, then success- ful separation of the ions becomes possible. The stron- ger the complex formed in solution by the counterion, the less this ion will be absorbed by the ion exchange resin. Thus, the separation completeness of the mixture   components can be enhanced. The chelating reagent α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (α-HIBA) and its salts (main- ly ammonium) are used in ion-exchange processes of intra- and intergroup separation of REE and TPE radio- nuclides of [5–17]. Cation exchange methods are used to separate REE and TPE radionuclides by elution with solutions containing α-HIBA and its salts. Strongly acidic styrene–divinylbenzene sulfonic cation exchange resins, such as Dowex 50W-X8, Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8, and a number of their other analogues, are utilized as sorbents [6, 10, 12–16]. As a rule, in the technique used [5, 6, 9–12], trivalent actinides are ﬁ rst adsorbed from a dilute (<0.5 M) HNO3 solution on a cation exchange + form, resin. Then the sorbent is converted into the NH4 and the actinides are eluted with a chelating reagent (α-HIBA). It was noted in [8, 14] that, without prelimi- nary conversion of the cation exchange resin to the am- monium form by eluating with an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, the released H+ ions have a strong inhibi- tory eﬀ ect on poorly sorbed elements, such as Cf. Anion exchange chromatography using a strongly basic anionite Bio-Rad AG X8 was chosen as a method for purifying Am, Cm from Pu impurities. According to the literature data, Pu(IV) sorption on strongly basic anion exchange resins is possible from nitric acid and hydrochloric acid media [18–20]. In nitric acid media, Pu(IV) can be sorbed starting from 1 M HNO3, 2– therewith the maximum concentration of the Pu(NO3)6 anion is reached at 7.7 M HNO3 [18]. Sorption of Pu on anion exchange resins is also possible from high concentration HCl solutions. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Pu(IV) increases monotonically with a rise in the HCl concentration and, starting from a 9 M concentration, exceeds 1 × 103 [19]. Under these conditions, Am(III) and Cm(III) are not retained by the sorbent. This work was aimed at developing regimes for the puriﬁ cation of Cm and Am from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as developing the regimes for the separation of Am and Cm and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by ion exchange chromatography.  Materials and equipment. All reagents used had a qualiﬁ cation not lower than extra pyre grade. Solutions were produced based on water prepared using a Simplicity UV water puriﬁ cation system (Merck). Nitric acid was prepared on an isothermal  distillation apparatus Distillacid BSB-939-IR (Berghof) for obtaining ultrapure acids. Solutions of α-HIBA ammonium salt were prepared from a sample of α-HIBA (Alfa Aesar) by neutralization with ammonia solution to the required pH value. The concentration of hydrogen ions in solutions (pH) was determined with a Mettler- Toledo SevenExcellence multimeter. The temperature of working solutions during preparation and all experiments was 22 ± 2°С. To maintain the required ﬁ ltration rate of solutions through the column and separation of the ﬁ ltrate into fractions, a programmable peristaltic pump Ismatec Reglo Digital MS-2/8 was employed.   241Am(III), 244Cm(III), 248Cm(III), and 249Cf(III) nitrates prepared in standard technological processes for the production of TPEs. 59Fe(III) nitrate was recovered by dissolving a fragment of the steel shell of the irradiated target and purifying it by anion exchange chromatography. 152Eu(III) nitrate was recovered from 153Gd production waste and puriﬁ ed by cation exchange chromatography. Analytical class sorbents were used in the study: Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 (50–100 mesh), Bio-Rad AG 50W- X8 (100–200 mesh), Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 (200–400 mesh).   for puriﬁ cation of Am/Cm from Pu and Fe. The initial solution was a mixture of radionuclides 59Fe(III), 240Pu(IV), 241Am(III), 244Cm(III) in 9 M HCl. To stabilize plutonium in the +4 oxidation state, H2O2 was added to the solution to a concentration of 0.1 M. The initial solution (5 column volumes, hereinafter c.v.) was fed to a column with a Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 sorbent (50–100 mesh) in the Cl– form (1 cm3column) at a rate of 1 mL/(cm2 min), then washed with 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2. Experimental procedure for the separation of Am and Cm and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu. The initial solution was a mixture of 241Am(III), 244Cm(III), 249Cf(III), and 152Eu(III) radionuclides in 0.1 M HNO3. The initial solution (1 c.v.) was fed to a column with a Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 sorbent (200–400 mesh) in the + form (10 cm3 column) at a rate of 1 mL/(cm2 min), NH4 then washed 0.1 M HNO3 and water. Desorption of the studied radionuclides was carried out with solutions of α-HIBA ammonium salt at various concentrations (0.1– 0.2 M), but with a ﬁ xed pH value (pH 5.0). This pH value was chosen based on the results reported in [5, 7]. Analysis methods. The volumetric activity of γ-emitting radionuclides (241Am, 59Fe, 249Cf, 152Eu) Fig. 1. Output curves of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am at sequential elution with 0.1 and 0.2 M α-HIBA ammonium salt solution (рН 5.0). Initial activity, Bq: 249Cf 1.7 × 106, 152Eu 8.46 × 104, 244Cm 1.23 × 107, 241Am 1.40 × 105. was determined using an SBS-50 γ-spectrometer with a GeLi semiconductor detector of the DGDK-150 type. Solutions of 1.00 mL in glass test tubes 12 mm in diameter were used as sources for measurements. The total activity of α-emitting radionuclides was measured using a Quantulus 1220 liquid scintillation counter. An Aspect α-spectrometer with a semiconductor detector based on an ion-implanted Si single crystal coated with an opaque Al layer was used to measure the contribution of individual nuclides to the total α-activity. The activity of the α-emitting radionuclide 244Сm was measured with an ESBS-7x α-spectrometer. Sources for measurement were prepared by depositing an aliquot of the measured solution on a metal substrate, drying under a lamp, and calcining to remove the salt layer.  Anion exchange chromatography using a strongly basic anionite Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 (50–100 mesh) was chosen as a method for purifying Am and Cm from Pu impurities [18–20]. Cation exchange chromatography with Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange resin (200– + form was chosen as a method for 400 mesh) in the NH4 separating Am and Cm, as well as for their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu, with an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution as an eluent [8, 9, 15, 16]. After separation of Am and Cm, the target fractions must be separated from α-HIBA. For this purpose, cation exchange chromatography was  utilized with Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange resin (100–200 mesh). As a ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation stage, the Fe impurity was separated by sorption from 9 M HCl on Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (50–100 mesh). from Pu and Fe. Microamounts of Pu were separated from Am and Cm by sorption of Pu on a strongly basic anion exchange resin Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 (50–100 mesh) from 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2 [20]. Americium and curium are practically not sorbed by the resin under these conditions. Puriﬁ cation in a hydrochloric acid medium is recommended in the presence of Fe(III) salts, since it allows achievement of simultaneous separation of Am and Cm from Pu and Fe. The fraction of Am and Cm contains no more than 0.5% Fe and no more than 0.1% Pu. Behavior of 152Eu, 249Cf, 244Cm, 241Am in a mixture during stepwise elution with α-HIBA. The initial solution (0.1 M HNO3) containing 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am, and 249Cf was passed through a chromatographic column with a Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange resin (200– + form with a 10 cm3 volume. After 400 mesh) in the NH4 washing the column with nitric acid and water, 20 c.v., 0.1 M and 0.2 M α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions were fed at the ﬁ rst and the second stages, respectively. The resulting output curves are shown in Fig. 1. The data obtained indicate an acceptable puriﬁ cation of Cm from Eu (0.1% Eu enters the Cm fraction), but there occurs insuﬃ cient Am and Cm separation: 1.0%         Table 1.

When using the 0.175 M and 0.15 M α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the second stage, 0.2 and 0.01% Cm enters the Am fraction, respectively. Characteristics of the chromatographic process.

The number of theoretical plates NA was calculated from the retention parameters of substance A by Eq. (1):  where VА is the retention volume of substance A, c.v. (volume of mobile phase used to elute a sample of a substance; it is determined between the point of sample injection and the point at which the maximum chromatographic peak is registered); WA is the substance A peak width at the base, c.v. (segment of the peak base cut oﬀ by two tangents drawn at the inﬂ ection   Distribution coeﬃ cient, DA Eu                        points of the ascending and descending branches of the chromatographic peak). The experimentally determined values of the chromatographic peak width at the base and the number of theoretical plates for Cf, Cm, Am, Eu at various eluent concentrations are given in Tables 1, 2, respectively.     where V is the volume of the sorbent layer (1 c.v.); VAꞌ is the reduced retention volume of substance A, c.v.; VM is dead volume, c.v. The dead volume VM required to calculate the volume distribution ratio includes the free volume of the column and the volume of communications between the eluent injection point and the column. The free volume of the column is taken to be 0.38 c.v., based on the data of [24] for the Dowex 50-X8 cation exchange resin (200–400 mesh). The volume of communications between the eluent injection point and the column was determined experimentally and was equal to 0.05 c.v. Thus, the dead volume of the VM is 0.43 c.v. The values of dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeﬃ cients are listed in Table 3.             The selectivity α (separation factor) of the chromatographic system. Quantitatively, the selectivity is expressed as a dimensionless value characterizing the separating power of the column with respect to the separated substances A and B and numerically equal to the ratio of the reduced retention volumes. It was calculated by Eq. (3):      where VA, VB are the retention volumes of substances A and B, c.v.; WA (WB) is the peak width at the base of substances A and B, c.v.   The results in Tables 1–4 show that with an increase in the α-HIBA concentration at the second stage of the stepwise elution process, the width of the chromato- graphic peak at the base diminishes and the number of theoretical plates rises, i.e., peak blurring is reduced. At the same time, the selectivity α and the resolution RS de- crease, i.e., the overlapping degree of chromatographic peaks increases. It was noted in [25] that two substances will be separated if the selectivity α > 1; for a satisfac- tory separation, RS must be equal to 1. The separation is considered complete if RS is equal to or greater than 1.5. Therefore, the Cm and Am separation, as well as their puriﬁ cation from Eu and Cf, is recommended to be carried out by stepwise elution with 0.1 M (pH 5.0) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the ﬁ rst and second stage, respectively. Puriﬁ cation of weight quantities 248Cm. The initial solution contained 26.6 mg (4.08 × 106 Bq) 248Cm, 2.60 × 10–2 mg (3.3 × 106 Bq) 241Am, and 2.38 × 10–3 mg (3.6 × 105 Bq) 249Cf. The radiometric methods used in this work show no Pu isotopes in the initial solution (the Pu content is below the detection limits), so the preliminary Pu separation on an anion exchange resin was not performed. A mixture of 248Cm, 241Am, and 249Cf radionuclides was separated on a column containing 10 cm3 of strongly acid Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange + form. The geometrical resin (200–400 mesh) in the NH4 parameters of the column are similar to the parameters  Table 4. Dynamic separation characteristics of Cf, Eu, Am, Cm Element A Element B Selectivity (separation factor) α                                                                             of the columns used when working with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am. The order of elution and the concentrations of α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions are similar to those used in experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am (Fig. 3). The content of 248Cm and 241Am and their distribution by fractions are shown in the output elution curves (Fig. 4). On the output elution curve of 248Cm (Fig. 4), the leading edge is more diﬀ use than in experiments with indicator amounts of this element (Fig. 3). Based on the data in [10], this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the distribution coeﬃ cient of Cm probably increases with a rise in its concentration. The relation- ship between the amount of a substance sorbed from the liquid phase and its concentration in this phase at a con- stant temperature is expressed by the sorption isotherm.      Fig. 4. Output curves of elution of weight amounts of 248Cm (248Cm 26.6 mg, 241Am 3.3 × 106 Bq, 249Cf 3.6 × 105 Bq) with α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, pH 5.0. At low concentrations, the amount of sorbed substance is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase, and a linear sorption isotherm is observed (the distribu- tion coeﬃ cient does not depend on the concentration of the substance in the liquid phase). Each component of the zone moves at a constant rate, since the linear rate of its migration depends on the ﬂ ow rate of the mobile phase, which is set constant. The entire zone moves with the same rate, remaining symmetrical: the concentration of the component is maximum in the center of the zone and decreases symmetrically towards the edges. There- fore, the peak on the chromatogram is also symmetrical (Figs. 1–3). If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeﬃ cient is greater than for low concentra- tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra- tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm). As a result, the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred and the peak is asymmetric. Since the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred when Am and Cf are removed from Am and Cf (Fig. 4), it can be assumed that the Cm sorption isotherm has a concave character. For a concave isotherm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diﬀ use leading edge; the retained volume increases with increasing ion concentration. For the speciﬁ ed Cm weight, the following charac- teristics were experimentally determined: the retention volume V = 35.4 c.v., the width of the chromatographic peak at the base W = 6.1 c.v., the dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeﬃ cient D = 35, the number of theoreti- cal plates N = 539. Comparison with the experimental results with indicator amounts of 244Cm (Table 2) shows that the number of theoretical plates N decreased when purifying the weight amounts of Cm. The result ob- tained agrees with the data of [9], in which the eluative separation of Am and Cm on a sulfonic cation exchange resin with α-HIBA was studied. It was shown in [9] that with an increase in the initial loading of the column with the mixture to be separated, the chromatographic sepa- ration eﬃ ciency of Am and Cm decreases (the number N of theoretical plates decreases). Using the developed technology, for the ﬁ rst time at RIAR, a 248Cm radionuclide material with a radionuclide and chemical purity signiﬁ cantly exceeding the indicators of preparations obtained using standard technology was produced [1–3]. The characteristics of the 248Cm preparation are as follows: the content of ﬁ ssion products (an activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.        The regimes of Cm and Am puriﬁ cation from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as the Am and Cm separation re- gimes and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by ion ex- change chromatography were determined. It was estab- lished that the separation of Pu microamounts from Am and Cm can be carried out by its sorption on a strongly basic Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (50– 100 mesh) from 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2. The Am and Cm separation and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by cation exchange chromatography with the α-HIBA ammonium salt solution as an eluent were tested. The REE and TPE separation is carried out in the regime of stepwise elution with the α-HIBA ammonium salt so- lutions of 0.1 (pH 5.0) (ﬁ rst stage) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) (second stage) concentrations. At the ﬁ rst stage of the process, Cf is recovered; at the second stage, Eu, Cm, and Am are separated. In experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am, the characteristics of the chromatographic process of cation exchange puriﬁ cation were determined: the number of theoretical plates N, distribution coeﬃ cient D, selectivity (separation factor) α, resolution RS. It was noted that upon puriﬁ cation of weight amounts of Cm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diﬀ use leading edge, i.e., the concentration Cm corresponds to the nonlinear section of the sorption isotherm. With a nonlinear sorption isotherm, the blurring of chromatographic zones increases and the eﬃ ciency of the chromatographic column diminishes (the number of theoretical plates N decreases and the resolution of the Am and Cm peaks decreases), resulting in reducing the separation completeness of these elements Puriﬁ cation of weight quantities of 248Cm was carried out, and the 248Cm preparation was produced with the fol- lowing characteristics: the content of ﬁ ssion products (the activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤ 2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.     2.
