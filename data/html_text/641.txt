The final solution was transferred to the electroplating cell for target plating.After electroplating, the                                     64                                    Ni solid target was examined by measuring                                     64                                    Ni thickness, composition and structure. The thickness was measured by alpha step apparatus, the composition was measured by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and the structure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Meanwhile, the identity of metallic impurities of the                                     64                                    Ni target was further analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).The                                     64                                    Ni targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the enriched                                     64                                    Ni (99.32%) solution prepared as described above. Electroplating of                                     64                                    Ni was realized using a plating vessel of our own design and manufacture (                                     Figure 1                                    ), where the Au disk was used as a cathode and platinum wire as an anode. The electrodeposition of                                     64                                    Ni was achieved at 2.4–2.6 V and 15–25 mA with the platinum anode at ~1 cm from the Au disk electrode. This process took 48–72 h. The enriched                                     64                                    Ni target was irradiated at 12.5 MeV (which decreased by Al) with 20 μA current on a Sumitomo HM-20 cyclotron (20 MeV) for about 5–7 h.                                     64                                    Cu was produced from the                                     64                                    Ni (p, n)                                     64                                    Cu nuclear reaction.After irradiation, the                                     64                                    Ni target was placed into the dissolving bath of 6 M HCl. The complete dissolution of the target material took about 40 min under heating, and then the solution was loaded on an anion exchange column (AG 1-X8) pretreated with 18 MΩ·cm water and 6 M HCl, sequentially. The enriched                                     64                                    Ni was eluted with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling, and the                                     64                                    Cu fraction was eluted with 1 M HCl, which was further evaporated to dryness. The residue was finally dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for further use. All of these procedures were performed using an automated system and carried out in a hot cell with remote control (                                     Figure 7                                    , Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).The radionuclide identity and purity of the produced                                     64                                    CuCl                                     2                                    solution were measured using γ-ray spectroscopy (HTA Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). In addition, the identity of radioactivity of the produced                                     64                                    Cu was further confirmed by measurement of its half-life, by measuring radioactivity at different time points. A decayed sample from the produced                                     64                                    Cu was also analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for traces of metallic impurities.To assess the quality of the produced                                     64                                    Cu (quantity, specific activity and purity), the synthesis of a radiotracer,                                     64                                    Cu-DOTA-rituximab, was performed. Here, the site-specific modification of monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab which contains two DOTA chelator in each antibody was used as we previously reported [                                     29                                    ]. The                                     64                                    CuCl                                     2                                    solution prepared above was reacted with DOTA-rituximab in a solution of pH = 5.5 at RT for 30 min. After incubation, the radiotracer was purified using a PD-10 desalting column, and characterized by Radio-TLC and Radio-HPLC, to determine the labeling yield and radiochemical purity. The identity of the radiotracer,                                     64                                    Cu-DOTA-rituximab, was further evaluated by PET imaging, which was carried out on a micro-PET rodent model scanner as reported earlier [                                     29                                    ]. After formulation,                                     64                                    Cu-DOTA-rituximab (0.5 mCi) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of the mice bearing Ramos RA1 tumors (                                     n                                    = 3), which overexpress CD20 antigen, and the animals were imaged with micro-PET at both 24 and 60 h post-injection.In this study, we presented the improved method for the preparation of                                   64                                  Cu, especially the improved efficiency of electroplating of                                   64                                  Ni. The                                   64                                  Ni solid target on an Au-disk has a uniform surface, with the thickness of 10.73 μm, and no metallic impurities. The total plated                                   64                                  Ni was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated                                   64                                  Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm                                   2                                  (assuming a uniform thickness). After irradiation of the target and purification, the gamma spectrum of the produced                                   64                                  Cu showed its radionuclide purity to be >99%, with both peaks at 511 keV and 1346 keV. In addition, the produced                                   64                                  CuCl                                   2                                  solution has high specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into the modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize                                   64                                  Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was further used successfully for micro-PET imaging.This work was supported, in part, by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81371592, No. 81401467, No. 81501519, No. 81571705 and No. 81671733), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 7162041 and No. 7171002), Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (215 backbone program), and 2017 Beijing Science & Technology Nova Star Program (xx2017016).Q.X., H.Z., X.M., Q.R., C.X. and Z.Y. conceived and designed the experiments; Q.X., H.Z., F.W. and X.M. performed the experiments; Q.X., H.Z. and X.M. analyzed the data; Q.X. and H.Z. wrote the paper.The authors declare no conflict of interest.Sample Availability:                                        Sample of the rituximab is available from the authors.
