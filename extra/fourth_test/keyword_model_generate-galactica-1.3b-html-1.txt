Context: Copper-64 is a useful radioisotope for positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efficiently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: In this study, we presented the improved method for the preparation of 64Cu, especially the improved efficiency of electroplating of 64Ni. The 64Ni solid target on an Au-disk has a uniform surface, with the thickness of 10.73 μm, and no metallic impurities. The total plated 64Ni was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2 (assuming a uniform thickness). After irradiation of the target and purification, the gamma spectrum of the produced 64Cu showed its radionuclide purity to be >99%, with both peaks at 511 keV and 1346 keV. In addition, the produced 64CuCl2 solution has high specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into the modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was further used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradiation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

Context: Cobalt-55 production was reported in 1938 from alpha irradiation of manganese [18] and has since been reported from many target materials and incident beams. Practically, two reactions are best suited for producing activities of cobalt-55 with few impurities: 58Ni(p,α)55Co and 54Fe(d,n)55Co, which are accessible on low energy cyclotrons [19]. These reactions have been thoroughly and recently reviewed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and significant independent efforts resulting in recommended excitation functions for the reactions discussed below [20].

Context: The 58Ni(p,α)55Co reaction has been employed by many groups [14,21,22,23,24]. Several radioisotopic and radionuclidic impurities can be formed in this process. Cobalt-57(t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 1377 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is produced from 58Ni(p,2p)57Co above 15 MeV [23], and production of cobalt-56 occurs above 25 MeV [25]. Nickel-57 (t1/2 = 35.68 h, β+ = 44%, Eγ= 1377.6 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is primarily produced via the 58Ni(p,2p)57Cu, which decays to nickel-57 with a half-life of 196 ms [21]. This reaction occurs above the threshold of 12 MeV, and is useful for monitoring separation efficiency during process development. However, nickel-57 decays to cobalt-57, which cannot be separated from cobalt-55. Natural nickel targets can also be used, but result in increased impurities that limit downstream clinical work [26].

Context: Deuteron bombardments can be used to produce cobalt-58m from enriched iron-57 via the (d,n) reaction, natural iron targets via the (d,n) reaction on iron-57 (2.2% abundance) or (d,2n) reaction on iron-56 (91.7%). Higher stopping power for deuterons reduces the quantity of isotopically enriched target material required, and deuteron-induced reactions’ excitation functions are often higher than similar reactions incited by proton beams. However, the relative thermal power density deposited in the target by the deuteron beam is higher than for protons. Accelerators with deuteron beams are also less common, and where they do exist, they usually have energies too low to utilize the entirety of even (d,n) excitation functions. Deuteron irradiations to produce cobalt-58m proceed on iron isotopes iron-57 and iron-58, which both exist in relatively low abundance, so as with proton irradiations, significant costs are associated with target materials.

Context: As in Figure 2, in Figure 6 “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the isomer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. Figure 6 above plots the excitation functions of natFe(d,xn) reactions that form cobalt-58m/g and enriched iron-57 can be used to increase yields and purities. Using lower-energy deuterons reduces the likelihood of the 57Fe(d,2n)57Co reaction occurring, which has a threshold energy of 3.9 MeV [40]. Overall, an enriched iron-57 target reduces radioisotopic impurities within the cobalt-58m sample. The possible 57Co-producing reactions excitation functions are shown in Figure 7. Sudar and Qaim examined the production ratio of the ground and metastable isomers of cobalt-58 from deuteron irradiations of natural iron targets [29] based on the assumptions that deuteron capture and iron-58 target reactions’ contributions are small, but to our knowledge, no measurements have been made of the formation of cobalt-58m/g using separated iron-57.

Context: Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations. These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts. A comparison of the experimentally determined thick target yields and theoretical yields are shown in Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16.

Context: To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelerator capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

Context: Anion-exchange chromatography also isolates cobalt-5x from iron target material [94]. After dissolving the target in acid, the iron is oxidized into the 3+ state with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of loading the cobalt-5x on to the anion-exchange resin and washing away the target material, as was performed in the nickel/cobalt anion-exchange separation, cobalt and iron are retained on the column when loaded. The cobalt can then be eluted form the anion-exchange column in 4 M HCl. The iron target will remain on the column during the 4 M HCl wash, but can be recovered in low concentrations of HCl. The HCl eluant containing cobalt-5x can also be evaporated and the cobalt-5x reconstituted in alternative matrices without incurring significant losses [26,28,86,87].

Context: The somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are a family of 5 G protein-coupled receptors that contain somatostatin-binding extracellular domains [101]. Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102]. Variations of somatostatin have been developed to bind to the SSTRs for the detection and treatment of cancers. These analogs deviate from the base structure of SST in ways that increase binding specificity and plasma stability [103].

Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126].
