Context: 225Ac isolation. Actinium was isolated by the scheme shown in Fig. 1. The procedure consisted of the steps of liquid extraction and extraction chromatography. Irradiated Th metal foils were dissolved in concentrated HNO3, the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 3–8 M HNO3, and Th was extracted with two portions of 1–5 M TBP or 0.1–0.5 M TOPO solution in toluene [21]. After the Th extraction, the aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, concentrated HClO4 was added, and the solution was evaporated to dryness to remove Ru isotopes. For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatography in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (TRUresin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) [11, 22]. After washing the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, Ac was eluted with the next 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, and the solution was collected. For complete purification of Ac, the extraction chromatography was performed twice. The radiochemical purity of 225Ac was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry with a semiconductor PIPS detector (Canberra).

For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatography in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (TRUresin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) [11, 22]. After washing the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, Ac was eluted with the next 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, and the solution was collected. For complete purification of Ac, the extraction chromatography was performed twice. The radiochemical purity of 225Ac was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry with a semiconductor PIPS detector (Canberra).
