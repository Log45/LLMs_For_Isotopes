Context: We determined the distribution ratios for each extraction system. The highest distribution ratio D is reached in the HBF4–TAPO system: 1.5 at low acid concentrations. High distribution ratio D is an advantage in commercial separation of boron isotopes, because at one extraction step the larger fraction of the substance is extracted, and thus the amount of the enriched product obtained increases.

Context:  Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly inﬂ uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetraﬂ uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances. Boric acid as a weak acid cannot be eﬃ ciently extracted into the organic phase without additional complexation; therefore, tartaric acid is added to aqueous boric acid solutions. Tartaric acid converts boric acid into a complex that is a stronger acid interacting with the extractant more eﬃ ciently. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid does not require such additives. It is interesting to consider organophosphorus compounds as extractants. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is one of the most readily available and widely used commercial extractants. Along with TBP, mixed trialkylphosphine oxide Cyanex 923 is used for the recovery of metal ions. Despite their wide use for the extraction of metal cations, there are few data on extraction of boron-containing acids with them. Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) were studied as extractants for acids structurally similar to HBF4, i.e., for monobasic complex metal-containing acids HMHal4, where М is a metal and Hal is a halogen. The data presented in review [5] show that compounds of metals in oxidation state (III) (such as Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III)) are extracted in the organic phase to form ion pairs consisting of solvated proton and metal-containing anion. HBF4 can be assumed to be extracted by OPCs by a similar mechanism. Mishra et al. [6] report the results of the extraction of HFeCl4 with tributyl phosphate (D = 3–8) and mixed trialkylphosphine oxides Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 (D = 2–8). Khoroshilov and Ivanov [4] studied the boric acid– TBP extraction system in the context of separation of boron isotopes. They obtained the single-stage isotope separation factor α = 1.0067 ± 0.0035 at 20–22°С. In this system, 10В was concentrated in the organic phase.

Context:  also an advantage for the extraction, because it increases the distribution ratio in the system. We determined the single-stage isotope separation factors α for the four extraction systems. The isotope separation in the systems with H3BO3 is not so high, which may be due to a signiﬁ cant change in pH of the aqueous phase upon ﬁ rst contact and cessation of isotope separation in the second and further extractions. On the other hand, the enrichment in the systems with HBF4 is higher than in the systems with H3BO3.

Context:  The synthesis and study of the properties of superheavy elements (SHE) is one of the fundamental areas of modern nuclear physics. Research in this area is being actively carried out both in Russia and in nuclear centers of other countries (Germany, Japan, USA). Thanks to the work performed at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (Dubna) and RIAR, nuclear- physical properties of new elements with serial numbers 115, 116, and 118 were synthesized and examined. These nuclides were prepared by irradiating targets based on highly enriched isotopes 243Am, 248Cm and 249Cf with 48Ca ions. Target materials are subject to high requirements for purity, as well as the content of radioactive impurities, which include Pu, Am, Cm, Cf isotopes and ﬁ ssion products. RIAR has an active production of 243Am and 248Cm radioactive materials [1]. Americium-243 is recovered from irradiated Pu by separation and precipitation methods [2, 3]. Curium-248 is recovered from aged 252Cf by extraction chromatography using HDEHP-based sorbents. As a rule, trace amounts

To stabilize plutonium in the +4 oxidation state, H2O2 was added to the solution to a concentration of 0.1 M. The initial solution (5 column volumes, hereinafter c.v.) was fed to a column with a Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 sorbent (50–100 mesh) in the Cl– form (1 cm3column) at a rate of 1 mL/(cm2 min), then washed with 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2. Experimental procedure for the separation of Am and Cm and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu. The initial solution was a mixture of 241Am(III), 244Cm(III), 249Cf(III), and 152Eu(III) radionuclides in 0.1 M HNO3. The initial solution (1 c.v.) was fed to a column with a Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 sorbent (200–400 mesh) in the + form (10 cm3 column) at a rate of 1 mL/(cm2 min), NH4 then washed 0.1 M HNO3 and water. Desorption of the studied radionuclides was carried out with solutions of α-HIBA ammonium salt at various concentrations (0.1– 0.2 M), but with a ﬁ xed pH value (pH 5.0). This pH value was chosen based on the results reported in [5, 7]. Analysis methods. The volumetric activity of γ-emitting radionuclides (241Am, 59Fe, 249Cf, 152Eu) Fig. 1.

Solutions of 1.00 mL in glass test tubes 12 mm in diameter were used as sources for measurements. The total activity of α-emitting radionuclides was measured using a Quantulus 1220 liquid scintillation counter. An Aspect α-spectrometer with a semiconductor detector based on an ion-implanted Si single crystal coated with an opaque Al layer was used to measure the contribution of individual nuclides to the total α-activity. The activity of the α-emitting radionuclide 244Сm was measured with an ESBS-7x α-spectrometer. Sources for measurement were prepared by depositing an aliquot of the measured solution on a metal substrate, drying under a lamp, and calcining to remove the salt layer.

Context:  The results in Tables 1–4 show that with an increase in the α-HIBA concentration at the second stage of the stepwise elution process, the width of the chromato- graphic peak at the base diminishes and the number of theoretical plates rises, i.e., peak blurring is reduced. At the same time, the selectivity α and the resolution RS de- crease, i.e., the overlapping degree of chromatographic peaks increases. It was noted in [25] that two substances will be separated if the selectivity α > 1; for a satisfac- tory separation, RS must be equal to 1. The separation is considered complete if RS is equal to or greater than 1.5. Therefore, the Cm and Am separation, as well as their puriﬁ cation from Eu and Cf, is recommended to be carried out by stepwise elution with 0.1 M (pH 5.0) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the ﬁ rst and second stage, respectively. Puriﬁ cation of weight quantities 248Cm. The initial solution contained 26.6 mg (4.08 × 106 Bq) 248Cm, 2.60 × 10–2 mg (3.3 × 106 Bq) 241Am, and 2.38 × 10–3 mg (3.6 × 105 Bq) 249Cf. The radiometric methods used in this work show no Pu isotopes in the initial solution (the Pu content is below the detection limits), so the preliminary Pu separation on an anion exchange resin was not performed. A mixture of 248Cm, 241Am, and 249Cf radionuclides was separated on a column containing 10 cm3 of strongly acid Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange + form. The geometrical resin (200–400 mesh) in the NH4 parameters of the column are similar to the parameters

Context:  There are at least three criteria in choosing the ra- dioactive isotope for in vivo and in vitro tracer studies. The radiation should be easy detectable; the half-life of the radioisotope should be neither too short nor too long; and the cost of the radioisotope should be moder- ate [1]. Lead-203 has a very simple decay mode (Fig. 1). It decays by electron capture followed by emission of γ-rays with energies of 279 (81%), 401 (5%), and 680 keV (0.9%). 203Pb with a half-life of 52 h is poten- tially useful for clinical scanning. High specific activ- ity and radiochemical purity of 203Pb are important for radiolabeling. 1–5 mCi of 203Pb radioisotope contains a trace amount of lead, which is less than 0.1% of the normal daily lead intake [2]. There are a number of methods for the 203Pb production [2–5]. Lead-203 is produced from either mercury or thal- lium target. Natural mercury has six stable isotopes. Several radionuclides of lead and thallium can be pro- duced by bombardment of natural mercury with 3He or 4He particles. Separation of 203Pb using this method is very difficult. The use of enriched mercury as a target material could partially solve this problem, but the cost of the obtained 203Pb will be very high. Therefore, the preferred target material for the production of 203Pb is

Then, the solution was alkalized to pH 12 with ammonium hydroxide. 203Pb is coprecipi- tated with ferric hydroxide. To separate trace amounts of thallium that can be adsorbed, the precipitate was dissolved in the same way, and washed with aqueous ammonia. Finally, excess ammonia was removed by heating.

Context:  The total amount of 203Pb before and after separa- tion was determined in all cases by the region of inter- est (ROI) values. The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods. The irradiation yield is 2.2 mCi μA–1 h–1.

Context: Abstract—A method has been developed for isolation of 228Ac from aged samples of natural 232Th. Macroscopic amounts of the thorium bulk (20 g) were separated by its extraction by a solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions, with microamounts of 228Ra and 228Ac remaining in the aqueous phase. 228Ac was selectively extracted from the resulting solution by the method of extraction chromatography on a col- umn with RE resin sorbent, and 228Ra quantitatively remained in the 4 M HNO3 eluate. 228Ac was washed out of the column with 0.05 M HNO3, it could be used as a radioisotope for research purposes. After the accumulation of the daughter 228Ac the solution of 228Ra in 4 M HNO3 was repeatedly passed through an identical column. The resulting 228Ac was used in the study to examine its sorption on commercial and modiﬁ ed carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) instead of the diﬃ cultly accessible 225Ac. It is shown that the application of CNMs as carriers of actinium isotopes for nuclear medicine purposes is promising.

Context:  same time, it was found that the desorption of 228Ac from DND-COOH, GO-H, and CNT-H samples under the same conditions does not exceed 5% in 3 h. The change in the behavior of Ac(III) in its sorption from PBS and desorption from BSA in PBS for the commercial DNDs, GO, and CNT and modiﬁ ed DND-COOH, GO-H,and CNT-H can be accounted for by various factors. The sorption of Ac(III) on a commercial sample of DNDs probably occurs by two mechanisms: ﬁ rm chemical binding of 228Ac with carboxy groups and physical adsorption onto other groups on the DND surface. In the case of DND oxidation to DND-COOH, these groups are substituted by carboxy groups, which negatively aﬀ ects the total amount of adsorption because of the Fig. 4.

Context: Abstract—Atorvastatin was radioiodinated and formulated using chloramine-T via an electrophilic substitution reaction for the development of a potential radiopharmaceutical for targeting liver. The impact of diﬀ erent reaction parameters and conditions that aﬀ ected the labeling yield such as pH of the reaction, concentration of atorvastatin and reaction time were optimized in order to increase the radioiodination eﬃ ciency. The labeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.41 %. In vitro analysis demonstrated that the compound was steady for up to 24 h. The liver uptake was 40.35% and the clearance pathways proceed via the hepatobiliary and renal clearance.

Context:  Atorvastatin is a representative of lipid-lowering drug family recognized as statins. It acts selectively in the liver as inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and cho- lesterol synthesis. It is chemically described as (3R,5R)- 7-[2-(4-ﬂ uorophenyl)-3-phenyl-4-(phenylcarbamoyl)- 5-propan-2-ylpyrrol-1-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acid [1]. The lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the radiolabeled complexes determines the binding aﬃ nity for hepatic transport proteins, the eﬃ ciency of their hepatocyte up- take, and the excretion pathways [2, 3]. Atorvastatin is taken up selectively into the liver (hepatocytes) via organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) [4, 5], excreted into the biliary system, and stored by the gallbladder [6, 7]. Atorvastatin is a lipophilic statin but is relatively hydrophilic compared to simvastatin and lovastatin, which makes it more hepatoselective and able to cross cellular membrane either by passive diﬀ usion and/or active carrier-mediated process [8, 9]. The liver-selective uptake and the tissue- speciﬁ c distribution of atorvastatin via organic anion transporters ensure high pharmacological eﬀ ect. In the liver, the statin drug undergoes Cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism [10–13]. The dominant active

Context: metabolites are 2-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid [14, 15]. Elimination of atorvastatin occurs from the systemic circulation through the liver via the bile into the feces and through the kidneys via the renal- urinary system [16–19]. Most of the hepatobiliary radiopharmaceuticals available for imaging are labeled with 99mTc. They exhibit identical pharmacokinetic properties in animals. They are eﬃ ciently removed from the blood by the liver and excreted into the bile. Moreover, they diagnose diseases of hepatocytic function and the functional status of the cystic duct and the gallbladder [6]. The mechanism of in situ oxidative radioiodination using chloramine-T (CAT), involving the formation of iodine monochloride (ICl), was elucidated [20, 21]. In weakly acidic media, CAT dissociates to ArSO2NCl– anion, which may react directly with iodide to form ICl. Subsequently the iodine monochloride (ICl) reacts with any position in the target molecule that can experience electrophilic substitution [20, 22]. Owing to the diﬀ erence in the electronegativity between iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and acts as a source of iodonium ion (I+). Therefore, aromatic electrophilic labeling with electropositive radioiodide usually proceeds in high radiochemical yield compared to 50% yield if molecular

Context:  Synthesis of 125I-atorvastatin was carried out by direct electrophilic substitution with no-carrier-added 125I (T1/2 = 60 days) under oxidative conditions in the presence of CAT. The presumable reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The TLC results show that radioiodide stayed near the origin (Rf = 0–0.1), while 125I-atorvastatin proceeded with the solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1). The radiolabeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.4% (n = 5). It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the puriﬁ cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin. These products might be accumulated in non-target organs. As we found, 125I-atorvastatin was stable for up to 24 h. The lipophilicity was determined by measuring the distribution of 125I-atorvastatin between n-octanol and

Context: With atorvastation, the yield was maximal at pH 5 (94.3 ± 1.4%). The iodonium ion attacks the site that is the most reactive in electrophilic substitution. At pH 4, the yield decreased to 90%. In alkaline medium, the yield was relatively low: 60.5% at pH 9 and 30.3% at pH 11.

Context:  The uptake in the lungs was small (1.42 ± 0.03%). The activity in the majority of organs decreased in the period between 0.5 and 4 h p.i., except for stomach and thyroid, where it increased with time. The increase in the thyroid radioactivity from 1.73 ± 0.03% at 0.5 h and 6.1 ± 0.3% at 4 h p.i. suggests the presence of free radioiodide, presumably due to the metabolism of the compound. The stomach and thyroid uptake shows that only a limited amount of radioiodine was released from the 125I-atorvastatin in vivo, conﬁ rming satisfactory in vivo stability and insigniﬁ cant biological decomposition due to metabolism. The in vivo stability complies with the high in vitro stability in human plasma. Predosing the mice with nonradioactive atorvastatin 0.5 h prior to the injection of labeled compound decreased the liver uptake to 19.25 ± 0.52% ID/organ. This result suggests that 125I-atorvastatin binds selectively to the liver and that the uptake was speciﬁ c. Similar radioiodinated compounds targeting liv- er such as m-iodobenzylguanidine labeled with 131I (131I-MIBG) show the uptake of 1.65% ID/g after 2 h [31]. Growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) labeled with 125I (125I-TGF-β1), targeting the liver, showed 2.4% ID/g [32].

Context: An eﬃ cient procedure was developed for selective radioiodination of atorvastatin via direct electrophilic substitution at ambient temperature in the presence of an appropriate oxidant, chloramine-T. The product showed good radiochemical stability and metabolic stability in vivo. The biodistribution studies carried out in mice expressed the aﬃ nity of 125I-atorvastatin for hepatic cells. 125I-labeled atorvastatin behaves as a lipophilic compound, is extracted by liver on hepatocytes, and is excreted into the bile duct and ﬁ nally into the intestine. The maximum liver uptake occurs approximately within 30 min after the injection. 125I-atorvastatin clears predominantly by the hepatobiliary pathway.

Context: Academic Editor: Derek J. McPhee Received: 21 February 2017; Accepted: 11 April 2017; Published: 17 April 2017 Abstract: Copper-64 is a useful radioisotope for positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efﬁcient production of high speciﬁc activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efﬁciently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with speciﬁc activity up to 5.6 GBq/µmoL. It was further incorporated into modiﬁed monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context:  In order to make 64Cu via the nuclear reaction of 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu, we made the enriched 64Ni targets on a gold (Au) disk by electrodeposition of 64Ni from an aqueous solution of 2+ at pH = 9.05, using a robust, reliable and user-friendly apparatus (Figure 1). The Au Ni(NH3)6 disk (30.8 mm diameter × 1.5 mm thickness) was used as a cathode, and a platinum wire was used as an anode. A cavity of 12.1 mm diameter and 0.2 mm depth was milled into the Au disk and 64Ni (99.32%) was plated into this cavity. The 64Ni electroplating was performed with a constant current of 15–25 mA at 2.4–2.6 V in the aqueous solution for 48–72 h. During the electrodeposition, the green color of the 64Ni plating solution gradually faded away and the bubbling of H2 gas was clearly visible. When the 64Ni plating solution became colorless, the electrodeposition was ﬁnished. The absence of Ni2+ was also conﬁrmed by analytical test strips. After cleaning and drying, the plated 64Ni on Au-disk was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, assuming a uniform thickness on the disk.

Context: After irradiation of 5 h, the 64Ni target was dissolved in 6 M hydrochloride acid, and then the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components. The 64Ni was washed out with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling. Due to the elevated cost of enriched 64Ni, recycling of the target material for re-use could reduce the production cost of 64Cu, without sacriﬁcing the quality of subsequent 64Cu production. When the eluted was switched to 1 M HCl, the ﬁrst band coming out was co-produced cobalt radioisotopes (approximately 1 mL), and the second was the 64Cu, which was collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for further use. The separation process of 64Cu took about 2.5 h after irradiation.

Context:  The quality of 64Cu produced was evaluated by analysis of its metallic impurities and measurement of half-life of its radioactivity. The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was used to evaluate the amount of metallic impurities in a decayed 64Cu solution, and showed a concentration of 6.339 ppb of Ni (0.127 µg), 4.112 ppb of Cu (0.082 µg), 5.502 ppb of Zn (0.110 µg), 0.108 ppb of Fe (0.002 µg), 0.102 ppb of Co (0.002 µg), 0.669 ppb of Ga (0.013 µg). The gamma spectrum of the produced 64CuCl2 solution (Figure 3) showed that the 64Cu radionuclide purity was >99%. The half-life of the produced radioactivity was determined by the radioactivity measured at different time points into the following equations: where A is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at time t, A0 is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at 0 h, and λ represents the constant. We obtained the following equation (Figure 4):

Context: The 64Ni targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the enriched 64Ni (99.32%) solution prepared as described above. Electroplating of 64Ni was realized using a plating vessel of our own design and manufacture (Figure 1), where the Au disk was used as a cathode and platinum wire as an anode. The electrodeposition of 64Ni was achieved at 2.4–2.6 V and 15–25 mA with the platinum anode at ~1 cm from the Au disk electrode. This process took 48–72 h. The enriched 64Ni target was irradiated at 12.5 MeV (which decreased by Al) with 20 µA current on a Sumitomo HM-20 cyclotron (20 MeV) for about 5–7 h. 64Cu was produced from the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction.

Context: dissolution of the target material took about 40 min under heating, and then the solution was loaded on an anion exchange column (AG 1-X8) pretreated with 18 MΩ·cm water and 6 M HCl, sequentially. The enriched 64Ni was eluted with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling, and the 64Cu fraction was eluted with 1 M HCl, which was further evaporated to dryness. The residue was ﬁnally dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for further use. All of these procedures were performed using an automated system and carried out in a hot cell with remote control (Figure 7, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

Context: Abstract—The results of destructive radiochemical and elemental analysis of samples of experimental mixed nitride uranium-plutonium (MNUP) fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor are presented. Data on the nuclide composition and weight content of U, Pu, Am, Cm, Nd were obtained, the speciﬁ c activity of 14C, 3H, 106Ru, the weight content of Zr, Mo, Pd, Rh in solution and in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF were determined. The burn-up depth of MNUP fuel is calculated from the ratio of the number of ﬁ ssion product atoms, burn-up monitor, to the number of heavy atoms. The total accumulation of 145Nd and 146Nd isotopes, as well as 148Nd, was used as burn-up monitor.

Context: the MNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1, and a series of model experiments to prove the completeness of the oxidation of various carbon forms to CO2 and the capture of the resulting carbon dioxide by alkaline traps [3], as well as the results of testing KETVS-1 for the content of iodine isotopes. After cooling the MNUP SNF solution to room temperature, the reﬂ ux condenser was replaced with a refrigerator, and part of the SNF solution was distilled oﬀ at a temperature of 110–120°C. The condensate was collected in a 50 mL volumetric ﬂ ask. The tritium content was determined in view of a preset proportionality coeﬃ cient (Kpr), which takes into account the tritium fraction that passed from solution to condensate. At a volume of the MNUP SNF initial nitric acid solution of 250 mL and a condensate volume of 50 mL, Kpr = 0.24 ± 0.02 [4]. The activity of 3H in the condensate solution and 14C in alkaline solutions of Petri absorbers was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The part of the SNF solution remaining after distillation was ﬁ ltered through a double cellulose “blue ribbon” ﬁ lter 11.0 cm in diameter with a pore size of 1–3 μm to separate the undissolved residue. The ﬂ ask with the initial solution remains was washed three times with 1 M HNO3 (25 mL). The washing solutions were used to rinse the ﬁ lters and combined with the basic SNF solution remaining after distillation. The double cellulose ﬁ lter with the undissolved residue of the SNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was separated. Each ﬁ lter was dissolved, and the contents of U, Pu, Zr, Mo, Pd, and Rh were determined in the resulting solutions.

Context: Uranium was determined by the spectrophotometric measurement of the light absorption of the uranium com- plex with arsenazo III; plutonium, by α-spectrometry; and ﬁ ssion products, by the atomic emission spectral method. The testing procedure is described in detail in [2]. At the ﬁ nal stage, 8 M HNO3 solution (200 mL) was added to a ﬂ ask with an undissolved fuel cladding, and control dissolution was carried out at a temperature of 95–100°C for 5 h. Upon dissolution process completion the α- and γ-spectrometric analyzes of the solutions were performed after the main and control dissolutions. The analytical line energies of radionuclides, their yields, as well as the half-lives for calculating the speciﬁ c activities of radionuclides when calculating their volumetric activity in term of concentration, were taken from [7, 8]. The isolation and puriﬁ cation of elements was car- ried out using a combination of cation-, anion-exchange, and extraction chromatograpy. The techniques devel- oped at RIAR were taken as the basis for the separation of SNF components. The isotopic composition of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, and Cm was determined in the isolated fractions. The analysis procedure is described in detail in [2–6, 9–11]. Quantitative determination of the U, Pu, Nd content was carried out by repeating the procedure for their isolation in the presence of a complex label by isotope dilution with mass spectrometric ending. To ﬁ nd the fuel burn-up depth, the value of 148Nd accumulation and the total 145Nd and 146Nd accumulation were used as monitors. When analyzing a sample of SNF MNUP irradiated as part of KETVS-1, aliquots were taken from the

Context:  be 8.2 × 103 Bq, and the 129I speciﬁ c activity will be 41 Bq/mL. For radiochemical studies of SNF samples, a hundredfold dilution of the initial solution is utilizsed. We failed to determine the 129I content in a dilute solution against the background of other SNF components. For detecting iodine, it is necessary to develop special procedures for its isolation from a SNF sample. The results of determining the isotopic composition and weight content of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, Cm in the MNUP SNF are given in Table 4. In parentheses are the values of the total absolute error in units of the last digits of the result for a conﬁ dence level of 0.95. When ﬁ ltering the MNUP SNF solution through a double cellulose ﬁ lter, a light gray coating was observed on the upper ﬁ lter. The sediment weight could not be ﬁ xed, since the initial weight of the cellulose ﬁ lter turned out to be greater than the weight of the ﬁ lter with sediment. This experimental fact is probably associated with the destruction of cellulose under the action of α- and γ-emitting nuclides. According to the data of [19–21], the sediment weight upon uranium oxide SNF dissolution in nitric acid is no more than 0.6% of the dissolved fuel weight. It was found in [22] that, upon dissolution of irradiated mixed-oxide fuel with a burn- up of 31.7 to 54.7 GW/t in 3 HNO3 at 95°С, the the undissolved sediment weight does not exceed 1.3% of the SNF weight. When studying the dissolution of model nitride SNF [23], the volumes of 7.8 and 9.44 M HNO3 required for dissolution were calculated based on the nal concentration of metals in the solution: 280 and ﬁ 400 g/L, respectively. It is shown that the weight of the undissolved residue is 1.8 and 2.26%, respectively. The results of detecting the content of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the solution and the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 5. The presence of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr was registered only on the upper cellulose ﬁ lter; there were no these elements on the lower ﬁ lter. The content of these elements in the solution obtained after the dissolution of the upper ﬁ lter was equivalent to their content in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF. The total weight of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 was 0.0019 g, which is 0.07% of the dissolved SNF weight. The results of determining the uranium and plutonium content in the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 6. The data in Table 6 indicate that the U and Pu contents in the upper and lower ﬁ lters are comparable. The close values of these quantities evidence that most of the U and Pu we found in solutions after the dissolution of the lters were sorbed by cellulose. ﬁ The excess of the U content in the upper ﬁ lter compared to the lower ﬁ lter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds. The weight of undissolved U estimated from the diﬀ erence between the U weight on the upper and lower ﬁ lters, is 2.5 mg, or 0.09% of the total uranium content in the analyzed SNF sample.

Context: For the ﬁ rst time, destructive radiochemical studies were carried out and experimental data were obtained on the composition of mixed nitride uranium-plutonium spent fuel irradiated in a fast breeder reactor. A complex technique for conducting destructive radiochemical studies, including dissolution, fractionation of SNF components, and measurements using nuclear-physical methods of analysis: α-, γ-, liquid scintillation, isotope dilution mass spectrometry, emission spectral analysis, was proposed and tested with real SNF. The isotopic composition and weight content of U, Pu, Am, Cm, Nd nuclides were measured, the 106Ru, 14C, 3H speciﬁ c activities, and the mass contents of Mo, Pd, Rh, and Zr in the solution and in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF were found.

Abstract: The emerging success of [68Ga/177Lu]Ga/Lu-DOTATATE as a theranostic pair has spurred interest in other isotopes as potential theranostic combinations. Here, we review cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m as a potential theranostic pair. Radionuclidically pure cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m have been produced on small cyclotrons with high molar activity. In vitro, DOTATOC labeled with cobalt has shown greater afﬁnity for SSTR2 than DOTATOC labeled with gallium and yttrium. Similarly, [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE has shown improved cell-killing capabilities as compared to DOTATATE labeled with either indium-111 or lutetium-177. Finally, PET imaging with an isotope such as cobalt- 55 allows for image acquisition at much later timepoints than gallium, allowing for an increased degree of biological clearance of non-bound radiotracer. We discuss the accelerator targetry and radiochemistry used to produce cobalt-55,58m, emphasizing the implications of these techniques to downstream radiotracers being developed for imaging and therapy.

Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradi- ation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

Context:  The highest-yielding reaction routes for relatively common cyclotrons with dual particle capabilities use proton or deuteron bombardment on iron targets. Cobalt-58m can be produced via the (p,n) reaction on iron-58, which has a natural isotopic abundance of 0.3%.

Previously reported excitation functions for (a) 58Fe(p,2n)57Co and (b) 58Fe(p,3n)56Co, measured using isotopically enriched targets [32]. Irradiating isotopically enriched iron-58 avoids the production of other impurities that cannot be separated out in the downstream chemistry. Natural iron is composed of iron-54 (5.8%), iron-56 (91.7%), iron-57 (2.2%), and iron-58 (0.3%). Proton bombardment of iron-54 leads to the production of very short-lived contaminants such as 54Fe(p,n)54Co (t1/2 = 1.46 m) and 54Fe(p,2n)53Co (t1/2 = 0.24 s) that do not diminish the radioisotopic purity of cobalt-58m. However, higher-energy proton reactions on iron-56 and iron-57, as described above for iron-58, may form longer-lived radioisotopic impurities cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Measured data from the relevant excitation functions are shown below in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4. Measured excitation functions for 56Fe(p,n)56Co (a) and 56Fe(p,2n)55Co (b) [32,33,41–45].

Context: Deuteron bombardments can be used to produce cobalt-58m from enriched iron-57 via the (d,n) reaction, natural iron targets via the (d,n) reaction on iron-57 (2.2% abundance) or (d,2n) reaction on iron-56 (91.7%). Higher stopping power for deuterons reduces the quantity of isotopically enriched target material required, and deuteron-induced reactions’ excitation functions are often higher than similar reactions incited by proton beams. How- ever, the relative thermal power density deposited in the target by the deuteron beam is higher than for protons. Accelerators with deuteron beams are also less common, and where they do exist, they usually have energies too low to utilize the entirety of even (d,n) excitation functions. Deuteron irradiations to produce cobalt-58m proceed on iron isotopes iron-57 and iron-58, which both exist in relatively low abundance, so as with proton irradiations, signiﬁcant costs are associated with target materials. As in Figure 2, in Figure 6 “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the isomer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. Figure 6 above plots the excitation functions of natFe(d,xn) reactions that form cobalt-58m/g and enriched iron-57 can be used to increase yields and purities. Using lower-energy deuterons reduces the likelihood of the 57Fe(d,2n)57Co reaction occurring, which has a threshold energy of 3.9 MeV [40]. Overall, an enriched iron-57 target reduces radioisotopic impurities within the cobalt-58m sample. The possible 57Co-producing reactions excitation functions are shown in Figure 7. Sudar and Qaim examined the production ratio of the ground and metastable isomers of cobalt-58 from deuteron irradiations of natural iron targets [29] based on the assumptions that deuteron capture and iron-58 target reactions’ contributions are small, but to our knowledge, no measurements have been made of the formation of cobalt-58m/g using separated iron-57.

Context:  Figure 6. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-58m,g from deuteron bombardment on natural iron targets. While 57Fe(d,n)58Co reaction is the dominant one, according to Su- dar et al., 56Fe(d,γ)58Co and 58Fe(d,2n)58Co data also contribute to the measured excitation functions [29,58–62]. Figure 7. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-57 from the 57Fe(d,2n) and 56Fe(d,n) nuclear reactions [58,59,61–65]. In Figure 7, an energy of 14.4 MeV is used as a cutoff to remove any data possibly acquired from 58Fe(d,3n)57Co reactions (threshold energy of 14.4 MeV). However, the threshold energy for 57Fe(d,2n)57Co is 3.9 MeV, and therefore it is difﬁcult to differentiate between the production via the 56Fe(d,n) and 57Fe(d,2n) reactions [40].

Context: Nickel targets can also be irradiated with protons to produce cobalt-58m via the 61Ni(p,α)58mCo nuclear reaction (see Figure 8). Natural nickel has 5 stable isotopes: nickel- 58 (68.1%), nickel-60(26.2%), nickel-61 (3.6%), and nickel-64 (0.93%). Figure 8. Excitations functions for the production of cobalt-58 on nickel-61 targets [37,66–70]. Data reported by Uddin et al., Michel et al., Amjed et al., and Hermanne et al. are from the irradiation of natural nickel normalized to the abundance of nickel-61, where data beyond the threshold energy for 61Ni(p,nα), 10.3 MeV, were not considered. Just as with iron targets, isotopically enriched nickel targets are required to reduce the production of radioisotopic impurities. Using enriched material prevents the production of long-lived cobalt isotopes via the (p,α) reactions on nickel-58 (68.1%), nickel-60 (26.2%), and nickel-64 (0.93%), shown in Figures 9–11 below.

Context:  Though the proton- and deuteron-induced reactions are most accessible to the majority of modern cyclotrons, there are alternative routes utilizing helium-4 ions, neutrons, or helium-3 nucleus with comparable cross sections [75–77]. Alpha beams afford a particularly attractive reaction route using monoisotopic manganese targets via 55Mn(α,n)58mCo. The measured excitation functions are shown below in Figure 12a. If higher-energy alpha beams are used, cobalt-57 can be formed from 55Mn(α,2n), as shown in Figure 12b. To decrease the likelihood of producing this contaminant, lower- energy beams should be employed to capture the greatest cross section for the 55Mn(α,n)58Co reaction while minimizing the 55Mn(α,2n)57Co reaction.

Context:  Figure 12. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-58 from (α,n) reaction (a) and cobalt-57 (b) on manganese- 55 [29,30,32,35,78–84]. In addition to charged particle-induced reactions, several alternative and less prag- matic routes to cobalt-58m can be contemplated, e.g., quasi-monoenergetic neutron or triton irradiations. Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons can be produced via 2H(d,n)3He re- action on hydrogen-2 gas targets. The neutrons bombard nickel or cobalt induce the 58Ni(n,p)58mCo and 59Co(n,2n)58mCo reactions [29,75]. Tritons can be generated via the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction within a nuclear reactor with an energy of 2.736 MeV. These ions go on to bombard [56Fe]Fe2O3 targets to produce cobalt-58m,g via the 56Fe(t,n)58mCo reaction route [76,85]. These alternative reactions currently rely on rare accelerator infrastructure or on signiﬁcantly increased scale in terms of beam intensities. Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations. These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts.

Context:  Figure 16. Thick target yield comparison between theoretical data and experimentally collected data for iron-58 targets at 10.1 MeV [87]. As mentioned above, the co-production of cobalt-58g with cobalt-58m is unavoidable. Valdovinos et al. determined that through the 57Fe(d,n)58gCo production route, cobalt-58g has an experimental yield of 131.5 ± 19.7 KBq/µA-h at 8.2 MeV with integrated currents ranging from 90 to 124 µA-h [26]. This impurity poses an issue to the application of cobalt- 58m due its long half-life and concomitant gamma emissions [88]. However, cobalt-58g can be useful for PET imaging of the biodistribution of radiolabeled agents. This potentially allows for determination of these agents’ biodistribution at timepoints many days after injection [89]. A summary of the discussed pragmatic production methods is shown in Table 2 below, highlighting the isotope produced, material needed with respective natural abundance, the reaction that must occur, and the possible radio-contaminants that may be co-produced.

Context:  Using the table above, it can be suggested that for the production of cobalt-55, iron-54 targets should be utilized based on the lack of potential long-lived radio-contaminants co-produced, and an increased yield at lower thickness targets when compared to yields produced by nickel-58. To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelera- tor capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

Context:  In summary, it appears that cobalt-labeled somatostatin receptor-targeted agents have the highest afﬁnity ever observed for SSTR2. DOTATATE labeled with cobalt-55 shows improved imaging characteristics as compared to DOTATATE labeled with copper-64 as nontarget uptake in the liver is reduced. As a therapeutic, [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE has shown promise as an effective auger emitter as it is has high afﬁnity for SSTR2 and is internalized to a high degree. Using cobalt-55- and cobalt-58m-labeled DOTATATE together as a theranostic pair is an enticing prospect.

Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popu- lar imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist pep- tides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding afﬁnity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding afﬁnity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110]. The ﬁrst cobalt-55 imaging of GRPR was reported in 2016 by Dam et al. [111] and compared 55Co-, 57Co-, and 68Ga-labeled GRPR agonist NOTA-AMBA (NOTA-Gly-4-ABz- Gln-Trp-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) in a PC3 prostate cancer. 57Co- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA-AMBA were found to have similar receptor afﬁnities, serum stabilities, and phar- macokinetics at 1 h and 4 h PI [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA enabled PET imaging at a 24 h timepoint (and beyond) which is not possible with [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-AMBA and revealed encouraging clearance of the tracer and stable late uptake of [5xCo]Co-NOTA-AMBA in the tumor [111]. In 2017, Mitran et al. reported radiolabeling GRPR antagonist RM26 (NOTA-PEG2- [D-Phe, Sta, Leu] bombesin [6–14]) with cobalt-55 and cobalt-57 [13]. Cell binding and internalization were investigated in PC3 cells and a mouse PC3 xenograft tumor model. They observed 12% cell internalization at 24 h which is similar to what has been reported for [111In]In-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 [112]. Biodistribution studies in PC3 tumor-bearing mice showed that at 3 h PI the tumor uptake was greater than uptake in any other organ including the kidneys. PET imaging studies using [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 showed clear tumor uptake at 3 h PI and by 24 h PI the tumor showed high uptake (Figure 20). The IC50 for Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (5.54 ± 0.4 nM) [10] is approximately 10-fold higher than Co-NOTA-AMBA (0.46 ± 0.20 nM) [13,111]. In vivo comparisons between [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA and [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 are complicated as the early imaging times are not matched between studies. However, comparison at the 24 h timepoint shows greater uptake of [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA than [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 in the tumor as well as many other organs. Even though the tumor uptake was less, the tumor to organ ratios for [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 were sometimes 100-fold greater than what was observed with [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. This was most notable in tissues with high GRPR expression such as the colon, pancreas, and stomach. The 24 h PI PET images provided, with both papers similarly showing lower non-target organ accumulation with the [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 than with [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. Recently, Mitran et al. investigated the impact chelator modiﬁcation had on PEG2- RM26 cell binding, internalization, and biodistribution in PC-3 prostate cancer [113]. PEG2- RM26 was bound to NOTA, DOTA, NODAGA, or DOTAGA and radiolabeled with cobalt- 55 and cobalt-57. The NOTA- and DOTA-labeled peptides showed the highest uptake in PC-3 cells in vitro and DOTA-labeled peptide had the highest tumor uptake in vivo by 24 h PI. In PET imaging studies, NOTA and DOTA PEG2-RM26 showed near-complete clearance of the radiotracer from the kidneys and GI tract by 24 h, whereas NODAGA and DOTAGA had residual GI and kidney uptake respectively.

Context:  Figure 20. PET/CT images of [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (C) at 3 h PI (A) and 24 h PI (B) show the reduction in background signal between early and late timepoint imaging. [13]. In summary, cobalt-labeled GRPR targeting agonist and antagonist peptides success- fully imaged PC3 prostate cancers. Therapy using a GRPR agonist peptide radiolabeled with cobalt-58m may be possible but would likely be limited by high uptake in non-target organs. Therapy with an antagonist remains to be determined but may suffer from low cellular internalization.

Context: More recently, bombesin analogues have been supplanted by prostate-speciﬁc mem- brane antigen (PSMA)-targeting agents in prostate cancer imaging, culminating in the NDA approval for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 [114–116]. In 2017, Dam et al. compared 68Ga and 55/57Co- labeled PSMA-617 with in vitro-speciﬁc binding and internalization assays in LNCaP and PC3-PIP cells [12]. Observed KD values for both agents were similar to [111In]In-PSMA- 617 [117]. In LNCaP cells incubated with [57Co]CoPSMA-617, >60% of the cell associated radioactivity was internalized after 30 min of incubation, which was higher than 68Ga-, 177Lu-, or 44Sc-labeled PSMA-617 [117,118]. PET imaging with [55Co]Co-PSMA-617 shows selective tumor uptake by 20 min P.I. and was sustained at 24 h PI. Additionally, by 24 h, tumor uptake was found to be higher than any other organ, including the kidneys [12]. Due to the improved internalization proﬁle and very high tumor uptake, it appears that [58mCo]Co-PSMA-617 would be a prime agent to be used for therapy. This is supported by its relatively rapid clearance in nontarget organs, especially the kidney.

Context:  Further investigation into the ZHER3 afﬁbody involved modifying the chelator to determine if imaging qualities could be improved [135]. In addition to NOTA, which was used previously, DOTA-, NODAGA-, and DOTAGA-tagged ZHER3 were 57Co labeled. In vitro assays showed nearly equal, blockable binding of the afﬁbody conjugated DOTA, NODAGA, and DOTAGA. The measured equilibrium disassociation constants, KD, were 0.2 nM for DOTA and DOTAGA constructs and 0.1 nM for the NOTA and NODAGA con- structs. Interestingly, the internalization fraction of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 in DU145 cells was observed to be 5% over 24 h, while their previous study showed as compared to 50% in their previous study [134]. In vivo, [57Co]Co-(NOTA/NODAGA/DOTA/DOTAGA)- ZHER3 were compared at 3 h and 24 h PI. The DOTA- and DOTAGA-conjugated afﬁbod- ies showed more rapid blood clearance than those labeled with NOTA and NODAGA. [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was compared to [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 at 3 h post injection and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was followed to 24 h (see Figure 21 below). At 3 h, [68Ga]Ga- NODAGA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor uptake but lower blood, liver, and small intestine uptake. By 24 h, [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor to organ ratios as 68Ga at 3 h PI [135]. Figure 21. Chemical structures and charges of studied cobalt-chelate complexes (A). SPECT/CT images of the [57Co]Co- HEHEHE-ZHER3-X afﬁbody with NOTA, NODAGA, or DOTA chelator (B). For each agent tested, the later imaging timepoint produced better tumor contrast. PET/CT of [68Ga]Ga-HEHEHE-ZHER3-NODATA was only possible to 3 h PI and showed greater kidney accumulation (C) [135]. The anti-HER2 [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C and anti HER3 [57Co]Co-ZHER3 afﬁbodies showed promising tumor uptake, rapid blood clearance, and good imaging properties in the models tested. They would very likely translate well for labeling with 55Co for PET imaging. As a potential therapeutic, a 58mCo-labeled HER2/HER3 afﬁbody may not show signiﬁcant internalization needed for effective therapeutic response.

Context: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) helps promote vascular development in tissues. overexpression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in some types of cancer [139,140]. A VEGF-targeting peptide L19K-FDNB was conjugated to NO2A or DO3A and labeled with cobalt-55 for PET imaging [14]. Uptake of the radiotracers was compared with the biodistribution of free cobalt. In tumor-bearing mice, free cobalt distributed primarily to the liver, kidneys, and heart while the 55Co-peptides were observed to clear through the kidneys. Unexpectedly, uptake in the tumors was highest for free cobalt, though it is unclear whether this is due to Ca2+ mimetic properties of Co or higher blood activity seen with free cobalt than the labeled peptides. The group had previously investigated [64Cu]Cu-NO2A-L19K-FDNB which showed higher tumor uptake than the cobalt-labeled peptides [141], which indicates that the afﬁnity of this peptide for targeting VEGF was negatively affected by radiolabeling with cobalt-55.

Context: Abstract—The possibility of producing 225Ac and 223Ra by irradiation of natural 232Th with medium-energy protons was examined. Thorium foils were irradiated with 90-, 110-, and 135-MeV protons at the accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Troitsk (Moscow oblast). The cumulative production cross sections for 225Ac were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, and for 227Th (223Ra precursor), 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. Based on the experimental data and theoretical calculations, the possible yields of 225Ac and 223Ra in irradiation of thick thorium targets at various accelerators were deter- mined. An efficient procedure was suggested for isolating the products from the irradiated targets: 225Ac, by liquid extraction and extraction chromatography, and 223Ra, by sublimation from a thorium–lanthanum melt followed by thermochromatographic separation in metallic titanium columns and extraction-chromatographic isolation of radium. The procedure allows production of large (units of curies) amounts of radiochemically pure 225Ac and 223Ra, which is promising for wide use of these radionuclides in nuclear medicine.

Context:  Actinium-225 (T1/2 = 10.0 days) is one of the most promising α-emitting radionuclides for therapy of vari- ous tumor diseases [1, 2]. It is also promising to use this radionuclide in generators as a source of the daughter short-lived 213Bi (T1/2 = 46 min). Various methods for 225Ac production are known [3]. Usually this radionuclide is isolated from products of 233U decay following the scheme 233U (T1/2 = 1.6 × 105 years) → 229Th (T1/2 = 7340 years) → 225Ra (T1/2 = 14.8 days) → 225Ac [4, 5]. Difficult availability of the starting 233U restricts the possibility of producing large amounts of 225Ac. 229Th, from which 225Ac is di- rectly isolated, can also be produced from 230Th (T1/2 = 75 400 years) by irradiation with fast neutrons or γ-quanta [6]. The starting 230Th is a member of the 238U radioactive series, and its content is about 20 g per ton of uranium, i.e., this material is also difficultly avail- able.

The elements were washed off from the surface of the titanium foil-collector with 7 M HNO3, and the resulting solutions were passed through an extraction-chromatographic column packed with the sorbent containing 4,4'(5')-di-tert-butylcyclo- hexano-18-crown-6 (Sr-resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.). Radium was eluted with a 7 M HNO3 solution. Under these conditions, Ra is washed out, whereas Ba and Sr remain on the column. The radiochemical purity of 223Ra was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry. To prepare specimens for α-ray spectrometry, a known aliquot of the solution was applied dropwise onto stainless steel disks. By this procedure, we prepared radiochemically pure Ac and Ra samples. Figure 3 shows the γ-ray spectra of the irradiated thorium target and of chemi- cally isolated Ac and Ra fractions.

Context: β+-decay of 227Pa produced by the (p,6n) reaction. The contributions of the direct 223Ra production and its pro- duction via 223Fr and 223Rn are insignificant (<1%). The experimental cumulative production cross- sections of 227Th, determined in this study for proton energies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, are 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. In Fig. 6, these data are given in comparison with the results of calculations by two versions of ALICE code and by the СЕF model. The theoretical and experimental values are in reason- able agreement. Figure 7 shows the calculated 223Ra yields in irra- diation of a thorium target (irradiation for 10 days, cooling for 16 days, an optimal dime for the decay of 227Th into 223Ra). The possibilities of 223Ra produc- tion at various existing accelerators are compared in Fig. 5.

Context:  Cadmium-109 is used for fabricating reference ion- izing radiation sources. It can be produced by neutron irradiation of silver. In irradiation of the starting material with >98% enrichment for 6 months in the SM reactor with ther- mal neutrons at a flux density of 1 × 1015 n cm–2 s–1, the total yield of all the Cd isotopes is about 50% rela- tive to the initial silver weight; the specific activity of 109Cd is 4–4.2 Ci g–1. The production of the desired radionuclide is accompanied by the production of a significant amount of 110mAg. The subsequent radio- chemical processing of the irradiated sample is per- formed to remove 110mAg from 109Cd, obtain the re- quired chemical form of the product, and regenerate expensive 107Ag for the repeated irradiation. The 110mAg/109Cd activity ratio in the final product should not exceed 3 × 10–4%. Extensive experimental data are available on the separation of Ag and Cd by ion exchange, extraction, and selective precipitation of Ag [1, 2]. The over- whelming majority of methods are methods of analyti- cal chemistry, unsuitable for operation with gram amounts of Ag and Cd in hot cells under the conditions of remote control. Only the precipitation methods based on precipitation of poorly soluble silver halides or of Ag metal after the silver reduction are an excep- tion. We believe that the precipitation of Ag metal, which is a compact readily settling powder that can be readily washed, is the easiest in implementation. This method was used for isolation and purification of 109Cd [3]; silver was precipitated from 0.1–2 M HNO3 in the presence of NaNO3 on SKN carbon sorbent. At equal initial activity of 109Cd and 110mAg, the Cd/Ag separa- tion factor was approximately 500–800. Final purifica- tion of Cd to remove Ag was performed by isotope dilution of Ag, followed by the AgCl precipitation. In contrast to [3], in numerous procedures for re- covering Ag from wastes the reduction, as a rule, is performed in weakly alkaline or ammonia solutions, because specifically in these media it is most complete [4]. This study was aimed at developing a procedure for Cd purification to remove Ag in one process cycle by reduction and precipitation of Ag from ammonia solutions, followed by the Cd concentration in the form convenient for the subsequent preparation of the 109Cd product (hydrochloric acid solution with preset HCl concentration). We chose as reductant hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS), which does not react with Cd. The precipitated Ag metal is the ready starting product for fabricating targets. Then, Cd is precipitated from the mother liquor in the form of basic cadmium carbonate, which is then readily dissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this study, we determined the conditions for the most complete reduction of Ag and precipitation of basic cadmium carbonate from ammonia solutions.

Context: To take full benefit of excitation function and to avoid the formation of the radionuclidic impurities, the proton entrance energy should be 14 MeV.18,19 The physical thickness of the silver layer is chosen in such way that for a given beam/target angle geometry the particle exit energy should be 5 MeV. According to SRIM code (The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter);25 the thickness has to be 352 µm for 90° geometry. To minimize the thickness of the silver layer, a 6° geometry is preferred, in which case a 35 µm layer is recommended. Silver targets are prepared by DC-CCE (constant current electrolysis) of the metal from alkaline plating solutions. An electrolysis solution is a volume of about 450 ml and a composition of 5.1 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.1 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3, while the current between the electrodes is adjusted to 0.05 A. The silver electroplating was performed in constant current. In 2 hours, a silver target of 36.75 mg.cm–2 thickness is prepared. Prior to the silver plating and to ensure a good adhesion, copper plate was cleaned using sandpaper of 1000 grade followed by rinsing copper plate with deionized water. Non-reactive plating vessels are hollow Perspex cylinders (diameter 6 cm, height 20 cm) fitted with an axial Pt anode wire mounted at the bottom by means of a tube-end fitting with perforated septum. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest Springer, Dordrecht Cadmium-109 is a radionuclide that can be used as an X-ray fluorescence source. It has a half-life of 462.6 days and decays by electron capture to 109mAg with γ- ray emission of 88.03 keV (3.79%) along with characteristic X-ray from the K level of Ag, with an energy of 22.54 keV (102%).1 This radionuclide can be employed for calibration of detectors and as a radioactive tracer of Cd.2–9 It can also be used in the (EDXRF) energy dispersion X-ray technique.10,11

Context:  Four symmetrical windows (22.36 or 11.69 cm2) on the vertical side wall allow up to four copper targets backing positioning. Each slot is sealed by an O-ring fitted window. The geometrical shape of the slot determines the actual target electrodeposition area. The liquid-tight sealing of the windows is realized by stainless steel mechanical pestles mounted on a PVC ring surrounding plating vessel and by pressing the copper backing against O-ring seal. An external PVC ring is fitted with four supporting pins to hold a motor-stirrer combination in position. The stirrer is a hollow perforated POM cylinder mounted on the axis of a DC motor and surrounding the platinum anode. The stirrer rotation speed is set at 600 rpm; during the process, its rotating direction is reversed after 8 seconds improving deposit homogeneity. To keep the desired temperature at a preset level, a heater (a series of six isolated 1 Ω/W resistors, through which an appropriate DC-current is forced (1.1 A, 40 °C up to 1.8 A, 60 °C) is circularly mounted at the bottom of the vessel. An insulated sensor, introduced through the stirrer support-plate, temperature. As monitors electrolysis to depletion requires long-time (up to 24 hours) plating, evaporation of plating solution occurs. To maintain a constant liquid volume (450 ml), a conductivity glass/graphite sensor monitors the solution level and actuates a peristaltic pump at the required rate, supplying distilled water to compensate evaporation losses. The rack-mounted home-made electronics includes a motor/stirrer control, an adjustable DC voltage generator card and four V/I converters coupled to current boosters.

Context: The freshly prepared solution of silver was poured into the plating vessel. This refined procedure is a result of several repeated experiments with different acidity and compositions of bath, different temperature and electroplating currents. The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined in by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (using a Joel Model JSM 6400 at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV). The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C (the temperature that the Ag layer can experience during a high current irradiation) for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water.

Context:  Since large amount of free cyanide in the bath forms a sedimentary layer on the Ag electrodeposition and consequently reduces the current efficiency, adjusting the quantity of free cyanide in the bath is important.26 On the other hand, less amount of free cyanide reduces the bath conductivity. Hence, the bath compounds should be optimized. According to some publications on concentrations of silver in the bath,21–26 a bath with 10.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 7 g.l–1 KCN and 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 was prepared. The data provided in Table 1 denote a poor current efficiency at high current density but also formation of chalk-white sediment on the Ag deposit. low Because in temperature, high current density and high free hydroxide,27 while application of a very low current density results in a rather poor quality of the deposit, and a very high current density reduces the over voltage of hydrogen and decreases the quality and the current efficiency.28 Hence, an optimal value was expected and investigated.

Context:  The current efficiency was determined at different current densities using DC current at room temperature (Table 1). An optimum DC current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 should be applied. Consequently, further experiments were carried out while using current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2, and changes were applied to the concentrations of bath compounds which consist of 8.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 8.5 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3. After changing the concentrations of the bath, the influence of acidity on current efficiency was concerned in further the experiments. These alternations had stopped undesired production of chalk-white sediment on the surface.

Context: the bath concentrations are held as low as practical considering the requirements of the job. In order to economize, some experiments were carried out with different silver molarities in plating solution. In this work based on the data in Table 5, it seems that the minimum amount of silver in the solution should be 4 g.l–1 to electroplate the layer with 100% current efficiency (Table 4).

Context:  Adjusting the bath acidity is important for the effect of bath efficiency and coating physical properties. A large reduction on acidity causes hydrogen reduction and simultaneously sediment of the basis salts on cathode. After preparing the silver bath (while the pH of bath was about 11) for studying the effects of solution the acidity was acidity on electroplating quality, changed from 8.5 to 13. It is clear that the higher current efficiency and the better electrodeposited layers are available in lower acidity than it is in comparison to electrodeposited layers by higher acidity bath (Table 2).

Context: Increasing the temperature of the solution increases the mobility of the ions and reduces the viscosity of the solvent. As a result it reduces concentration polarization and thus enhances the quality of the deposit (fewer tendencies the current to dendrite formation) and efficiency.28 The mean current efficiency was 100% at a current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2, 40–50 °C temperature and time of 2 hours (Table 3).

Context: Silver is a relatively noble metal; most metals being less noble than silver form immersion deposits on the surface. This tends to happen even when the base metal enters the silver solution hot or live, that is, with a voltage already applied. The inevitable result of this phenomenon is poor adhesion of subsequent deposits. To minimize this effect, it is essential to employ a silver strike coating prior to the main deposit.21,24 In this work experiments were carried out on adhesion with and without strike coating. It was concluded that if the plating were carried out very rapidly, a good adhesion would be obtained in all electroplated targets without the need for strike coating. Embrittlement of metals has been recognized for many years but, as two authors have pointed out, some other defects in electrodeposits, such as blistering, cracking, gas pits, peeling off and poor adhesion, may also be related to hydrogen in ways not yet identified.26 Plating on a dietary or greasy surface inevitably leads to blistering or peeling of deposit. Cathodic cleaning in either acid or alkaline solutions provides large quantities of hydrogen for absorption.26 In all experiments, the substrate surface was cleaned with sandpaper of 1000 grade and immersed in the nitric acid bath of 0.3M. Then the surface was washed by water and its oil contaminators were removed by a mixture of the alkali cleaning powders. Finally, the surface was washed with acetone.

Context:  After finding the most economic and qualitative bath concentrations, some experiments were carried out for 2 to 10 hours for the solution that contained 5.16 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.16 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 at 24 °C. When the best quality and current efficiency was obtained in these experiments at room temperature and without adding any additives, a suitable molarity of the bath composition produced the current efficiency of 100% (Table 5). To estimate the quality of the electroplated silver targets some criteria had to be taken into account, such as homogeneity, morphology, visual appearance of the silver layer and thermal shock test. The homogeneity of the silver layer is important as it may seriously affect the production rate of 109Ca. This was determined by measuring the thickness of several parts of the layer by a micrometer and calculation of the standard deviation of the data.

Context: The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The evaluation of quality of the layers was achieved by comparison of the photomicrographs in terms of size and form of the Ag nuclei and the extent to which they overlapped each other. The smaller, more spherical and the more overlapping nuclei were considered to be a good plating quality. The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water. Observation of neither crack formation nor peeling off of the silver layers indicated a good adhesion for the purpose. SEM photomicrograph showed that the granulometry of electroplated targets with current density of 8.54–12.82 mA.cm–2 were not as desired (Figs 1a and 1b). Hence, current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 was chosen and the SEM photomicrograph showed a suitable granulometry (Figs 2 and 3). The SEM photomicrograph of the best electrodeposition of these baths is shown in Fig. 3.

Context:  Abstract—Zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrices were prepared by mixing solutions of zirconium oxychlo- ride, selenous acid, and sodium molybdate in different manners. The elution of the generated 99mTc radioactiv- ity from the obtained zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrices was studied using small chromatographic col- umns of the matrix. 6 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix dried at 50°C, packed in a glass column (1.1 cm i.d.), was eluted by passing 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 and ambient temperature (~25°C). The 99mTc elution yield of 77.1% was obtained. Radionuclidic, radiochemical, and chemical purity of the eluate proved to be suitable for use in medical applications.

Context:  In nuclear medicine, 99mTc is the most frequently used radiotracer because of its suitable physical and nuclear properties. It emits monoenergetic (140 keV) γ-photon suitable for γ-cameras. In addition, its half- life of 6 h is suitable for performing the required tests without exposing the patient to unacceptable radiation dose. Planar cameras are used for bone scanning with 99mTc-MDP, and SPECT cameras are used for cardiac 99mTc-Sestamibi [1–7]. Cyclotron- scanning with produced 99mTc is not practical because of the high cost and short half-life [8–10]. The main source of 99mTc is the β–-decay (87.5%) of 99Mo (T1/2 = 65.94 h). Techne- tium-99m of high purity, suitable for medical applica- tions, is obtained by elution of radioisotope generators based on alumina columns loaded with fission 99Mo of high specific activity [11]. Other sorbents were also tested for preparing 99Mo/99mTc generators, such as silica gel, hydrous zirconium oxide, manganese diox- ide, and hydrous titanium oxide [12]. The main disad- vantage of these generators is the limited adsorption capacity of the base material for 99Mo, which, in turn, requires the use of 99Mo of very high specific activity (of the order of tens thousands Ci g–1), produced from nuclear reactors via fission route. Generation of high amounts of intermediate and long-lived fission product waste as a result of complex multistep separation and purification of fission 99Mo in expensive hot cells with sophisticated equipment and infrastructure are the

Context: main disadvantages of fission 99Mo radioisotope gen- erators [13]. Alternative technologies are required to overcome these drawbacks. These alternative technolo- gies are based on incorporating neutron activation 99Mo of low and medium specific activity (0.3– 3.5 Ci g–1 Mo) into insoluble precipitates of high Mo content such as Ce, Zr, Mg, Ti, Fe, Th, Sn, and Te compounds, which are then used as column matrices [14–28]. Post- and pre-irradiation-formed gels are the two common techniques used for preparing gel genera- tors. Isotope exchange allows overcoming the radiation degradation resulting from irradiation of the prepared gel material and the multistep procedure in pre- and post-irradiation-formed gel techniques, respectively [16, 29]. Solvent extraction of 99mTcO4 – or sublimation of 99mTc2O7 has also been used in some generator sys- tems for extraction of 99mTc from 99Mo of relatively low specific activity, produced by direct neutron acti- vation of molybdenum targets [12]. This study was aimed at preparing 99Mo/99mTc gen- erator based on zirconium selenomolybdate as a col- umn matrix by post-irradiation-formed gel technique.

Context:  Radiometric identification and measurements were made with a multichannel analyzer (MCA) of Inspec- tor 2000 model, Canberra series (the United States), coupled with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) coaxial detector of GX2518 model. A UV-160 A UV-VIS spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was used for deter- mining Zr and Mo. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with an 18 kV diffractometer (D8 Ad- vance, Bruker, the United States) with monochromated CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Elemental analysis was carried out with a BW-1200 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Philips, Netherlands). The morphology was examined with a JSM-6510A field emission scan- ning electron microscope (FESEM) (Japan). The IR spectrum was recorded with an MB157S FT-IR spec- trometer (Bomem, Canada) in the range from 4000 to 400 cm–1 at room temperature. Thermal analysis, in- cluding simultaneous thermal gravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal (DTA) analysis, was carried out with a DTG-60H device (Shimadzu, Japan). Radioactive 99Mo solution. 99Mo was obtained by eluting a 99Mo/99mTc generator with alumina-packed columns (Mon-Tek Generator, Monrol Nuclear Prod- ucts Industry and Trade, Turkey), loaded with 20 GBq on calibration date. Each column was eluted with a 2 M NH3 solution. The 99Mo eluate was passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter to retain any possi- ble alumina particles. The ammonium molybdate-99Mo solution was gently heated to dryness and then redis- solved in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Alternatively, for pre- paring 99Mo/99mTc generators, solutions of fission 99Mo (~100 mCi) in 0.1 M NaOH solution were obtained from the ETRR-II Radioisotope Production Facility (RPF). Then, 99Mo solution was diluted with 1.0 M HCl to the desired pH value. Preparation of zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrix. 0.25 M Mo(VI) solution was prepared by dis- solving 3.025 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O in a small portion of distilled water with the addition of 5 mL of a 99Mo solution along with a few drops of 30% H2O2. The re- sulting sodium molybdate solution was warmed to de- stroy excess H2O2 and then cooled to room tempera- ture before adjusting to pH about 4.5 with 2 M HNO3. The volume of the Mo(VI) solution was completed to 50 mL with distilled H2O. 0.25 M Zr(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 5.062 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O in a small portion of distilled water and then was com- pleted to 62.5 mL, after which it was heated to 60°C and then left to cool to room temperature (~25°C).

For dry elution studies, a stream of air was passed through the molybdate bed to keep it free from the in- terstitial saline solution for the next elution. Preparation of 99mTc generator based on zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel matrix. A glass col- umn (1.1 cm i.d.) was packed with 6 g of the zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel. The generator was conditioned for elution of 99mTc by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution through the column bed and then left overnight to be ready for the elution of the gener- ated 99mTc radionuclide. The 99Mo content in the eluate (99Mo breakthrough) was determined, in the case of its presence, as the con- tribution of the count rate of 181 or 739 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum to the total count rate. The γ-ray spectrum of the eluate was measured directly after elu- tion and after 3 days. The radionuclidic purity of the eluted 99mTc was determined as the contribution of the count rate of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum. The radiochemical purity defined as the percentage of 99mTc radioactivity present in the 99mTcO4 – form was determined by ascending paper chromatography using Whatman no. 1 chromatographic paper and 85% methanol as a developing solvent. The activity distri- bution along the chromatogram was determined with a γ-ray spectrometer, and Rf was calculated as the ratio of the distance (cm) traveled by 99mTc species from the starting line to the peak position to the distance (cm) traveled by the solvent from the starting line to the sol- vent front. The possible Zr, Mo, and Se impurities in 99mTc eluate were determined by ICP and/or UV-VIS spec- trometry. The zirconium selenomolybdate gel prepared under optimum conditions was characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TGA, DTA), XRD, XRF, and FESEM.

Context: gel matrix (ZSM-1) shows the presence of extra water molecules in addition to –OH groups and metal oxides present in the material (Fig. 1). The bands observed at 878 and 722 cm–1 may be due to metal–oxygen bonds, which are manifested in the range 650–1000 cm–1. The band at 1380 cm–1 belongs to bending vibrations of metal-bonded hydroxyl groups. The strong and sharp peak at 1617 cm–1 may be due to HOH bending vibra- tion. The absorption bands at 2900 and 3421 cm–1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of coordinated wa- ter [30, 31]. Figure 2 shows the TG and DTA curves of the zir- conium selenomolybdate gel. The first step in the TG curve between 40–200°C with the weight loss of 11.58% corresponds to the loss of physically adsorbed water and water of crystallization with an endothermic peak in the DTA curve at 125°C. The weight loss in the range 200–440°C was small (2.6%). An endother- mic peak observed at 500.6°C with the weight loss of 11.165% in the range 435–530°C can be assigned to the evaporation of SeO2 and coordinated water and to decomposition of hydroxyl groups. The weight loss in the range 600–900°C was 4.51%. The presence of suit- able amounts of water in the gel material is important to enhance the 99mTc diffusion through the gel material during the elution [32]. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dried zirconium selenomolybdate gel, which shows that it is amorphous. The amorphous structure is much better than the crystalline structure because of more efficient diffusion of the eluent through the amorphous material, increasing the elution yield. The SEM images of the prepared ZSM material at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the gel matrix has a porous basic structure, which makes it good material for diffusion of 99mTc during elution [33].

Context: This is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 3.78 days) (cid:0) -decay with an (cid:3)impurity(cid:4) of electron undergoing (cid:2) capture (7.47%) [2]. Short path length of the electrons (their maximal energy is 359.2 keV) in living tissues allows destruction of tumors up to 1 mm in diameter. The intrinsic (cid:5)-radiation of the radionuclide (the ener- gy of its main transition, 137.2 keV with an intensity of 9.47%, is approximately the same as that of 99mTc widely used in SPECT, 140.5 keV) is well detected with a commercial scintillation (cid:5)-ray camera and allows efficient monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body. The main goals of this study are as follows: deter- mination of the reaction cross sections and energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deu- teron energies (<14 MeV); study of the specific fea- tures of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets in relation to the gas medium composition; development of a diffusion-thermal procedure for isolating 186Re; mastering of procedures for preparing cyclotron tar- gets from isotopically enriched (186W) powder materi- als; and preliminary radiation and materials-science studies of the new types of the targets.

Context:  The energy dependences of the reaction cross section and yield of 186Re in the energy range 12.84/5.85 MeV (energy threshold of the reaction 3.58 MeV) were measured using foil stacks. To determine the integral deuteron beam current, (cid:0)2, we used iron monitors (surface density 16.5 mg cm chemical purity no less than 99.9%) which were ar- ranged along the deuteron beam before and after the tungsten samples [4]. Radiation materials-science studies of cyclotron targets based on isotopically enriched powdered 186W. Preliminary radiation materials-science tests of cyclotron targets were performed on a U-120 cyclo- tron using deuteron beams (initial energy 13 MeV) of various intensities (maximal beam current 8 (cid:6)A, beam power up to 40 W). The cyclotron targets were W/C composites com- pacted under a pressure of 340 (cid:0)370 atm. Graphite was added as an inert weakly activated (its proton or deuteron irradiation yields only ultra-short-lived radio- nuclides 11C, 13N) binder having high thermal con- ductivity. The W/C ratio was varied from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1; the surface density with respect to natW was 290 (cid:0) (cid:0)3. 300 mg cm The intergal deuteron beam current was also deter-

Context:  The discovered phenomenon formally resembles the classical emanation of inert gases from crystalline salts [14] and release of volatile fission products from UO2 [15]. It should be emphasized that such processes are observed only in systems with polymorphism. In par- in the Sn:113mIn system the release of the ticular, 113mIn atoms into the gas phase starts in the tempera- ture range of the (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:5) polymorphous transition (from 453 K), and in the Cd:111In system no (cid:3)volatili- zation(cid:4) of impurities is observed even at temperatures (575(cid:0)585 K) [16]. approaching the melting point Studies of the emanation in the Sn:113mIn system also showed that the release of the impurity atoms into the gas phase depends on the nuclear and physicochemical history of the sample, conditions of foil annealing, and composition of the gas medium [10, 11]. As in the case of the Sn:113mIn system, in the W:186Re system we also observed the release of daughter atoms into the gas phase, taking place only in a combination with a polymorphous transition. An- nealing of the irradiated metal at temperatures below the phase transition point (<1000 K) was not accom- panied by the egress of 186Re from the bulk of the metal (these experiments were performed only with

Context: americium into an independent fraction with followed its transmutation in fast neutron reactors [1]. Previously, we proposed a method for separating the actinide–lanthanide fraction from a highly active raﬃ nate during the extraction with TBP in an isoparaﬃ n diluent in the presence of iron nitrate as a salting- out agent [2]. In this case, one of the most important radiochemical problems is the subsequent separation of americium from curium and lanthanides. This separation is necessary for a number of reasons. First, the lanthanides are neutron poisons; some isotopes have a high neutron capture cross section, and their presence in the fuel will inhibit the transmutation of americium [3, 4]. Secondly, the involvement of curium isotopes in a closed nuclear fuel cycle is problematic, since it has a high level of neutron and thermal radiation, which will complicate the manufacture and operation of regenerated homogeneous nuclear fuel or americium targets for its transmutation.

Context: Figure 1 shows the spectrum (1) of an initial 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing trivalent Am, Cm, and Pr with the concentrations given in Table 1 as well as spectrum (2) of the same solution after the quantitative oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) according to the procedure described in the experimental part. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the presence in the solution of an almost 100-fold excess of Pr compared to Am (10.5 and 0.13 g/L, respectively) does not aﬀ ect the Am(III) oxidation. We preliminarily studied the extraction of Am(VI) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the pres- ence of 8 M NH4NO3 with 30% TBP in Isopar-M (Table 1). It can be seen from the data in Table 1 that both trivalent Cm and Pr and Am(VI) are extracted to a high degree (up to 95 wt %) under the conditions of the study. The distribution coeﬃ cients (D) of Am(VI), Cm(III), and Pr(III) per an extraction were about 2.5, 3.6, and 1.8, respectively. DAm(VI) = 2.5 correlates with the data of [21], where the maximum distribution co- eﬃ cient was achieved at 4 M HNO3 and the minimum phase contact time, and, however, it was slightly lower than in [16], where 100% TBP was used for extraction. Spectrophotometric method was applied to prove that agent by heating the solution at 90°C for 20 min according to the procedure described in [11]. The eﬃ ciency of this method is usually limited by nitric acid concentrations of no more than 0.5 M [18]. At higher acid concentrations, ammonium persulfate decomposes to form hydrogen peroxide, an eﬀ ective reducing agent 2+ [19]. However, this eﬀ ect, apparently, can be for AmO2 leveled by increasing the concentration of the oxidizing agent to 1.6 M [14], which enabled oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) in 1 M HNO3 by 90 ± 5%. A solution containing Am(V) was obtained by adding 1 μL of a 37% H2O2 solution to 1 mL of an Am(VI) solution in 0.1 M HNO3 previously prepared as described above. The authors of [20] report the possibility of direct preparation of Am(V) in 0.1 M HNO3 by heating to 80–100°C and an ammonium persulfate concentration of 1 M. The completeness of Am(III) oxidation to Am(VI) and its subsequent reduction to Am(V), their behavior during extraction, as well as the concentration of Pr(III) in the solution were monitored by a spectrophotometric method (Unicam UV-300, Unicam Instruments, UK) according to absorption bands at 503 and 814 nm for Am(III), 513 and 717 nm for Am(V), 666 and 996 nm for Am(VI), and 445 and 592 nm for Pr. In extraction experiments, a 30% TBP solution in Isopar-M was used, which was preliminarily contacted for 5 min with an equal volume of a 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing 0.2 M (NH4)2S2O8. Before extraction, a weighed portion of NH4NO3 was introduced into the resulting solutions containing Am(VI) or Am(V), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, to achieve its concentration in the solution of 8 M, as in [13]. Extraction of actinides and Pr was carried out for 1 min at a ratio of aqueous (A) and organic (O) phases of 1 : 5. As we determined earlier [13], 1 min is enough to set thermodynamic equilibrium at the distribution of Am(III) and Cm between a nitric acid solution containing NH- 4NO3 as a salting-out agent and 30% TBP in isopar-M. The phases were brought into contact with each other by shaking the tubes by hand for 1 min. The phases were then centrifuged to separate them for about 1 min at 2000 rpm. After the phases were separated and analyzed. The total concentration of Am and Cm in the used solutions was found by alpha spectrometry (Alpha Analyst, Canberra, USA).

Context:  Am(VI) in organic phase is reduced mainly to Am(V) and partially to Am(III), and after 1 day storage, Am(V) completely transforms into Am(III). However, in some works, contradictions were noted regarding the stability of Am(VI) in the presence of TBP. Thus, the authors of [14, 16] point to the relative stability of Am in the or- ganic phase, while it was stated in [21] that contact with organic phase led to a rapid americium reduction result- ing in a lower D(Am) than expected. Thus, from the data in Table 1, it can be concluded that Am(VI), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, is successfully extracted with 30% TBP in Isopar-M from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of NH4NO3 salting-out agent. Therefore, this approach to the separation of Am(VI) from Cm and lanthanides un- der these conditions is technologically unrealizable.

Context:  Fig. 2. Absorption spectra of Am(V) and Pr(III) in 0.1 M HNO3 before (1) and after (2) adding salting-out agent (8 M NH4NO3). The main problem of using Am(V) for its separation from Cm and REE is its reduction to Am(III), which is well extractable under these conditions. The Am(V) reduction occurs under the action of radiolysis products [22], disproportionation of Am(V) [23], and due to contact with organic phase. Selection of the conditions under which the extraction of Am(V) in TBP will be minimal without replacing TBP with the TODGA extractant, which is not yet available for industrial technology, as was done in [24, 25], will make it possible to achieve the quantitative separation of americium from curium, as well from lanthanides. Thus, an important task for future research is the stabilization of americium in its weakly extractable form Am(V).

Context: The isotope 90Sr, formed during the ﬁ ssion of uranium and plutonium nuclei, together with 137Cs makes the main contribution to the global pollution of water and soil on Earth. Atmospheric nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility of 90Sr brings about its distribution in the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of living beings, where it concentrates in the bones and damages the surrounding tissues. The obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment is complicated by its nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the matrix material, exposure until equilibrium with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid– liquid extraction is widely used for the separation of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is eﬃ ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2]. But in both cases, a preliminary acid digesting of the samples is necessary, which involves the use of toxic and aggressive reagents. We proposed

Mixtures of alkylammonium salts with organic acids, binary extractants, eﬃ ciently extract metals [4]. Phenolic groups are known to dissociate in alkaline media, and a similar eﬀ ect can be expected for mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with alkylammonium salts.

Context: Abstract—Various methods have been developed for the extraction of a promising medical radionuclide 117mSn from proton-irradiated TiSb intermetallic compound, a target material suitable for irradiation with an intense beam of accelerated protons. To separate radiotin from Ti, Sb, and radionuclides of other elements, methods of ion- exchange chromatography and liquid extraction were used, in particular, the anion-exchange separation of tin and titanium in the form of a peroxide complex in HCl solution, extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions, and chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from citrate solutions. As a result, 117mSn of high purity, which meets the requirements for nuclear medicine, was obtained. Keywords: 117mSn, TiSb intermetallic compound, proton irradiation, separation of radiotin and titanium, ion exchange, extraction. DOI: 10.1134/S1066362221060114 In recent decades, the therapy of oncological and other human diseases with the use of radiopharmaceuticals (RP) has developed signiﬁ cantly. More than 80% of cancer patients suﬀ er from bone metastases [1]. Interstitial radionuclide therapy using RP based on radionuclides releasing electrons is one of the eﬀ ective methods of treating patients with widespread bone metastases. RP based on the 117mSn radionuclide (in particular, 117mSn4+DTPA) [2–5] have a number of advantages over other drugs. The decay of the metastable radionuclide 117mSn is accompanied by the release of monoenergetic conversion electrons (127, 129, and 152 keV) with a short and discrete range of 0.2–0.3 mm in biological tissue. Soft radiation leads to a local eﬀ ect on tumor cells without damaging healthy tissues. The γ-radiation (159 keV) during the decay of 117mSn may be used to control the therapeutic eﬀ ect (theranostics). Clinical trials of drugs 117mSn4+DTPA for the relief of bone pain, 117mSn4+DOTA-annexin for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and the 117mSn colloid for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are being successfully carried out [1, 6]. Until recently, 117mSn was produced mainly from the reactions of stable tin isotopes, 116Sn(n,γ)117mSn or 117Sn(n,n’γ)117mSn, with neutrons. In this case, the speciﬁ c activity of 117mSn did not exceed 740 GBq/g (20 Ci/g) [2, 7]. The presence of stable tin seriously limits the possibilities of medical application of the reactor-produced 117mSn. A product with a high speciﬁ c activity can be obtained via reactions with accelerated charged particles, of which two approaches are the most promising and demonstrate comparable production rates of 117mSn: nat,121,123Sb(p,x)117mSn [8, 9] and 116Cd(α,3n)117mSn [10,11]. Nowadays, powerful and compact cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type, developed and manufactured by the IBA Company (Belgium), are becoming more widespread, capable of accelerating proton beams with an intensity of more than 300 μA to an energy of 70 MeV. Such cyclotrons are successfully applied for large-scale production of radioisotopes, mainly for medical purposes [12, 13]. On the basis of experimentally determined cross sections, it was shown [14] that the 117mSn radionuclide can be produced by proton irradiation of an antimony target with an initial energy of 145 MeV and below. Irradiation of natural antimony or antimony enriched with 123Sb with the proton energy 55 or 70 MeV, respectively, leads to the formation of 117mSn, which contains a trace amount of the undesirable long-lived radioisotope 113Sn. The presence of another long-lived radioisotope 119mSn (Т1/2 = 293 days), as impurity, which releases soft

Context:  For the chromatographic puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, we prepared 10 mL of model solutions containing Ti, Sb, H2O2, 6 M HCl, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn). The content of Ti varied from 1.5 to 30 g/L, the Sb content varied from (2–5)×10–3 g/L, a value corresponding to the addition of the 124Sb label, to 14.4 g/L, the H2O2 : Ti molar ratio was from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1. The label was obtained from an irradiated antimony target. The sorption and desorption of tin was performed under dynamic conditions by passing the solution through a column (d = 0.6 cm) with a sorbent layer 6 cm high. Two anion-exchange resins were used as sorbents: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Before ﬁ lling the column, the sorbents were kept in 6 M HCl for 12 h. First, 10 mL of the initial solution was passed through the ﬁ lled column at a rate of 0.8 mL/min and then 40–50 mL of a 6 M HCl washing solution passed. For desorption of radiotin, 1–4 M HNO3 solutions were used. Model solutions used for extraction have a total acidity of 6.6 M and a volume of 30 mL and contain 4.66 М HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, Ti (20 g/L), Sb in the form of antimony chloride with a concentration from (2– 5)×10–3 to 1 g/L, and 0.2–1 М KI. Also, (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn) produced from the irradiated antimony target was added to the model solution as label. To prepare a model solution, a weighed portion of KI was preliminarily dissolved in a minor amount of water and added, with vigorous stirring, to a mixture of HClO4 and H2SO4 acids. Iodine was formed, and the larger the weight of KI sample, the darker the solution. However, even at low KI concentrations, when the solution was light yellow, a precipitate formed, presumably HIO. The solution was left for a day to reach equilibrium. Then, it was ﬁ ltered, and the label and stable titanium and antimony were added, and after that, the extraction was performed. The prepared solution was stored for no more than a week. As the organic phase, we used benzene previously saturated with a solution of 4.66 М HClO4 +

At each stage, the stirring time of the phases was 30–40 s, and separation time, 10 min. The radiotin was reextracted in 60 mL of 1.5 M HCl (stirring time 5–6 min, and separation time, 17–20 min). At the ﬁ nal stage, exhaustive puriﬁ cation and concentration of radiotin on silica gel from a model solution of 2 M HNO3 labeled with 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was performed, according to the procedure described in detail in [15]. To study the interaction of the TiSb intermetallic compound with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were dissolved by heating in concentrated HCl, to which H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 were added, as oxidizing agent. The completeness of dissolution was controlled by weighing the undissolved residue. The content of titanium and antimony in the residue and the concentration of antimony in the solution were calculated from results of the spectrophotometric determination of the titanium concentration in the solution. For testing the developed technique, we manufac- tured, irradiated, and processed an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound. An intermetallic compound with a mass of 16 g was dissolved according to the procedure worked out on nonirradiated samples. The concentration of antimony

Context:  – selective elution of titanium with respect to radiotin should be carried out in a 6 M HCl (for a chromatographic column volume of 2.5–3 mL and a sorbent layer height of 6–7 cm, 50 mL of 6 M HCl is suﬃ cient). For desorption of radiotin, a 2 M HNO3 solution heated to 40°C should be used; with the above column parameters, 25 mL of 2 M HNO3 is suﬃ cient to extract 98–99% of the radiotin. The puriﬁ cation factor from Ti depends on its concentration in the initial solution and reaches 104 at a titanium concentration of 25 g/L; a puriﬁ cation factor of up to 106 may be achieved after two stages of chromatographic puriﬁ cation. Extraction separation of radiotin from titanium. Along with the chromatographic method, extraction methods are also used to separate radiotin from titanium macroquantities. One of these methods is extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone [19]. Our model experiments showed that methyl isobutyl ketone extracts up to 80% of radiotin from 7 M HCl, while the titanium concentration decreases 200 times. The extraction of radiotin from a solution of 7 M Another extraction method of separation from titanium, providing up to 99-% yield, is the extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions. This method was studied for the separation of milligram amounts of tin from titanium and antimony in [21]. The behavior of a no-carrier-added tin may diﬀ er from the behavior of macroscopic amounts of tin. The diﬀ erence in the extraction behavior of tin is mainly inﬂ uenced by the concentration of stable antimony and iodide ions. It was shown in [15] that after the removal of antimony by extraction with dibutyl ether, a minor amount of it nevertheless remains in the solution. At the ﬁ rst stage, the eﬀ ect of the concentration of antimony in the initial solution on the extraction of radiotin with benzene was studied. In this case, the KI concentration was kept constant (0.5 M). In the studied range of antimony concentrations (2–5) × 10–3–1 g/L, at least 98% of radiotin is extracted with two 10-mL portions of benzene. The dependence of the extraction of antimony on its concentration in the initial solution is demonstrated in Fig. 5. As seen, the more antimony in the initial solution, the more it is extracted into the organic phase (salting out eﬀ ect). Therefore, the antimony concentration should be minimal.

Context:  Thus, titanium can be almost completely removed from radiotin by extraction with benzene, whereas trace amounts of antimony and tellurium present in the product may be removed by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel. On processing an irradiated antimony target, such a ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation was performed in a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5), which, in turn, was prepared from a 10 M HCl solution, which is determined by the previous stage of processing described in [15]. In the case of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, a sodium citrate solution was prepared from a 1.5 M HCl solution, and in the case of chromatographic separation on AG 1 × 8 resin, the preceding solution was 2 M HNO3, not HCl. We checked how traces of nitrate ions aﬀ ect the chromatography eﬃ ciency on silica gel, the formation of antimony complexes with citrate ions in particular. To do this, a citrate solution containing 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was prepared starting from a 2 M HNO3. The solution was passed through a column ﬁ lled with SiO2, then the column was washed, and radiotin was eluted with 6 M HCl according to the method described in [15]. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 8. It follows from Fig. 5 that the radionuclides Sn, Sb, and Te behave in the same way, as in the absence of nitrate aions. In this case, about 45% of 44Ti remains on the column. Isolation of radiotin from an irradiated TiSb sample. After the process of radiotin separation was studied in model experiments, an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound was fabricated and irradiated. The chemical and physical properties of TiSb have been little studied. To study the interaction of TiSb with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were successively dissolved in concentrated HCl and then in concentrated HCl with the addition of HNO3. Heating TiSb in concentrated hydrochloric acid caused solution to turn violet (owing to the formation of Ti3+ ions). As the sample dissolved, the reaction rate decreased. The addition of H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 leads to the resumption of dissolution. However, in this case, Ti3+ transforms into Ti4+, causing precipitation and passivation of the TiSb surface. We succeeded in performing complete dissolution as follows. The bead of the compound was placed in a ﬂ ask, and a concentrated HCl was added. The ﬂ ask was heated for 12 h at reﬂ ux temperature. Solution (no. 1) turned deep violet, indicating the formation of Ti3+ ions. Then, the insoluble residue was transferred into a ﬂ ask with a fresh portion of concentrated HCl, and

Context: Ti, 114mln, 46Sc tellurium occurs. For the ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of the radiotin, chromatographic separation on silica gel was carried out as described above. As a result, the total yield of 117mSn was 75–82%, the puriﬁ cation factors for Sb and Ti were about 106, and the radionuclidic purity of 117mSn was no less than 99.9% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated). Second portion of the solution prepared by dissolving TiSb was transferred into a solution containing 4.66 M HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, and 1 M KI, and the radiotin was extracted twice with benzene. Then, radiotin was reextracted from benzene with 1.5 M HCl. Like chromatography, this method provided puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, indium, and scandium radionuclides. Trace amounts of antimony and tellurium impurities (Table 4) remained after the extraction were removed by further adsorption on silica gel from citrate solutions. In the given case, the total yield of 117mSn was 80– 85%, the puriﬁ cation factor for Sb and Ti, about 106, and the radionuclidic purity was no less than 99.7% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated).

Context:  Dowex 1 × 8 anion exchangers from a 6 M HCl solution in the presence of H2O2. It was shown that AG-1 × 8 provides higher puriﬁ cation eﬃ ciency. In the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, the best results were achieved for the extraction of radiotin with benzene from a solution containing a mixture of perchloric and sulfuric acids and iodide ions with a concentration of 0.5–1 M. Each of the methods used has its own advantages and disadvantages [30]. In our case, the advantage of extraction in comparison with chromatography is the short time of the process, and the disadvantage is a slightly lower yield of radiotin and worsening of its puriﬁ cation from titanium at a residual concentration of antimony in the initial solution above 0.1 g/L. In our opinion, the method of titanium separation on the AG 1 × 8 anion exchanger is most preferable, since it, although being more time-consuming, is less sensi- tive to the antimony content in the initial solution (about 1 g/L), and is also easier-to-implement in hot chambers. In both methods, the separation of radiotin was terminated by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate at pH 5.5. As a result, the 117mSn product with high radionuclidic purity and high speciﬁ c activity was obtained in at least 75-% yield, which is promising for the development of production technology of 117mSn in large quantities in the future.

Context:  Abstract(cid:0)Diffusion-thermal procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I for radionuclide therapy and positron emission tomography are suggested. For these procedures, new cyclotron targets of metallic tantalum were developed, which, when exposed to high irradiation doses, ensure the absence of physicochemical interaction (diffusion, alloying) of materials being activated and final products with the support at high temperatures. The thermal, hydrodynamic, and strength characteristics of zinc and tellurium (elemental Te) cyclotron targets were evaluated. For commercial target assembly of the COSTIS system, the operation parameters of the proc- ess for preparing 124I from elemental tellurium using the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerators were determined. Recent efforts of leading scientific laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Hammersmith Hospital, etc.) were focused on the development of procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I [1(cid:0)3]. This is due to the unique nuclear-physical properties of 67Cu and 124I, possibility of their production on compact cyclotrons, accelerators of high-energy charged particles, electron accelerators, and moderate-power reactors, and also to rich and well-studied chemistry of these elements. 67Cu is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 2.58 days) undergoing (cid:2)-decay (100%) [4]. A short path of elec- trons with the energy from 181.5 to 575.0 keV in a living body allows elimination of tumors with a diam- eter of up to 5 mm [5]. The inherent (cid:3)-ray radiation of this radionuclide, whose energy spectrum and quan- tum yield (see below) are similar to those of 67Ga widely used in single-photon emission tomography, is efficiently registered with a commercial scintillation (cid:3)-ray chamber providing reliable monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body. E(cid:2), keV (%) [4] 390.4 (57.2) 481.7 (21.6) 575.0 (20.0) 181.5 (1.1) E(cid:3), keV (%) [4] 184.6 (48.7) 93.3 (16.1) 91.3 (7.0) One more undeniable advantage of 67Cu is forma- tion of stable compounds with monoclonal antibodies, which provides target transport of radiopharmaceuti- cals (RPs) to the affected organ, high radiation doses within this organ, very low irradiation of intact tissues, and restricted capacity of tumor cells to regenerate the DNA structure after irradiation with electrons. 124I is a positron emitter. Replacement of the key diagnostic radionuclide iodine-123 by 124I in known RPs such as solution of sodium iodide, solution of sodium o-iodohippurate, m-iodobenzylguanidine, and Iodofen would substantially improve these prepara- tions.

Context: Copper-67 can be isolated in a metallic vacuum chamber providing the residual pressure in the work- ing volume as low as 10(cid:2)6 mm Hg. The pilot model was presented previously in [14]; now in collaboration with the Institute of Analytical Instrument-Making we developed a new commercial installation. The chamber is equipped with special fittings for connect- ing a vacuum pump (turbomolecular pump is prefer- replaceable con- able), denser for the evaporated staring isotope and impurity gallium radionuclides, water supply unit, valves for inert gas supply, heater, and thermocouples. The con- denser is hermetically connected to a water supply unit, which is connected through a pipe with a water cooling system used in the course of distillation to maintain the required temperature. A furnace (equipped with a holder for irradiated target) is ar- ranged over the condenser using a movable rod; the required temperature is controlled with thermocouples.

Context:  The optimal energy of protons and the yields of the final product and impurity 123I were evaluated using the reference data [7]. However, the data on the in- dustrial production of 124I at the Hammersmith Hos- pital (London, the United Kingdom) [3] showed that the absolute yields of 124I given in this handbook are underestimated by a factor of almost 3.5. For example, the yield of 124I at irradiation of the enriched tellurium target with 12.5-MeV protons is 2.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, and not 0.76 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, as given above. At the same time, the ratios of 124I and 123I are similar: only 2% of 123I is remains in the target after irradiation of the enriched tellurium (99.8%) target.

Context:  Using the procedure for longitudinal flow along an impermeable plate [17, 18], we determined the coeffi- cients of heat transfer of tantalum in water of 98 000 (cid:0) 67 200 W m(cid:2)2 K(cid:2)1, decreasing in the direction from the center. Taking into account these coefficients, we found that the maximal temperature in the irradiated layer of elemental tellurium is lower than 545.6 K (272.6(cid:8)C). Thus, our calculations showed the principal suit- ability of the target of elemental tellurium deposited on a tantalum support; the most dangerous cross sec- tion of the support operates under the compression conditions, which allows the beam current to be in- creased to 20 (cid:5)A. To decrease the deflection of the tantalum support (i.e., to eliminate the possibility of exfoliation of elemental tellurium), its thickness can be increased to 1(cid:0)1.5 mm.

Context: In the horizontal chamber (40 mm internal diameter and 150 mm length) 124I is separated from irradiated elemental tellurium in the course of its melting. Under these conditions, the vapor pressure of Te is about 0.4 mm Hg, which is close to that of TeO2 at radio- chemical treatment of the commonly used targets [20]. Then the desired product is transported with a flow of heated inert carrier gas through a horizontal-vertical chamber (internal diameters of the horizontal and ver- tical sections of the chambers are 16 and 10 mm, respectively) to a trap with 0.01(cid:0) 0.02 M NaOH.

The dotted line is the calculated 90Y decay curve. eﬃ ciency is observed for impurities of aluminum, phosphorus, and calcium (Kpur = 2.7–3.9). During the experiments, three consecutive treatment cycles were carried out without replacing the sorbent. The results obtained showed that the puriﬁ cation factors remain at a constant level. Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The sorption method was tested for direct separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair without using the extraction method. The sorption completeness of 90Y and 90Sr on the ﬁ rst column ﬁ lled with phosphate cation exchange resin D5041 can be evidenced by the change in the relative beta activity (A/Ain) of the ﬁ ltrate over 35–50 days. The results are shown in Fig. 2a, curve 1. These results demonstrate that sorption from a 0.01 M HNO3 solution is accompanied by the combined sorption of 90Sr and 90Y. The relative beta activity of the ﬁ ltrate changes relatively little over time and its equilibrium value is about 20% of the initial value. With an increase in the nitric acid concentration the time dependence of the A/Ain value of the ﬁ ltrate changes sharply. At a 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 concentration at ﬁ rst the A/Ain value is ~0.4, and the equilibrium value, 0.8–0.9. This fact indicates that during the sorption of the equilibrium 90Sr/90Y mixture in this acidity range, almost all 90Sr remains in the ﬁ ltrate, and 90Y is completely sorbed on the column. When the sorbent is washed after sorption with 0.2–0.3 M HCl, additional elution of residual amounts of 90Sr occurs.

Context: solutions with a concentration above 3 M the complete yttrium extraction occurs, while the sorption of strontium and corrosion products on this sorbent practically does not occur. This allows at the sorption stage to carry out deep puriﬁ cation of 90Y from 90Sr and a wide range of chemical impurities (chromium, manganese, nickel, lead, iron, zirconium). The unique sorption properties of the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent make it possible to aﬀ ord pure 90Y radiopharmaceuticals without employing the extraction method that is complex in hardware implementation. At the ﬁ rst stage of the process, selective sorption of 90Y from weakly acidic media is carried out on a phosphate cation exchange resin, where the main part of 90Sr is separated and passed into the ﬁ ltrate. Desorption of 90Y from the phosphate cation exchange resin with 3 M HCl and then 90Y sorption from the hydrochloric acid desorbate on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent allow deep puriﬁ cation both from residual amounts of 90Sr and from chemical impurities of corrosion products. Elution of 90Y from the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent is easily carried out with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, which is the preferred medium for obtaining 90Y-based radiopharmaceuticals.

Context: 2-Ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) is a promising extractant in the REE production, since systems based thereof have higher separation factors of lanthanides [14]. The task of the extraction method is to separate 177Lu as fast as possible because of the short half-life, from the main mass of ytterbium, ensuring the most convenient subsequent handling of the recovered lutetium. This work is aimed at assessing the possibility of using the organophosphorus extractants Р507 and Cyanex-272 for the separation of pure lutetium.

Context: 289.138 and 369.419 nm; lutetium, 291.139 and 302.054 nm. Extraction tests were carried out in test tubes with a volume of 15 mL. The phases were in contact for 5 min. Reextraction of Lu and Yb from the organic phase was carried out with 5 M HNO3 solutions. Before taking the back extract for analysis, the samples were centrifuged to completely separate the aqueous and organic phases. Then the concentrations of ytterbium and lutetium in the back extracts were determined. Solutions of Yb and Lu metals were prepared according to the standard procedure: metal oxides (99.99%) weighed on a Mettler Toledo ML303T/A00 analytical balance (accuracy class II), were dissolved in concentrated 8 M nitric acid at heating without boiling. The solution was evaporated to dryness. After cooling, the resulting mixed salt was dissolved in 1 M HNO3, transferred into a 25-mL volumetric ﬂ ask, and made up to the mark with distilled water. As a result, standard solutions of 20 g/L Lu and 200 g/L Yb were prepared. Working solutions were produced by diluting the standard. Working concentrations varied from 0.05 to 200 g/L. The concentrations of standard solutions were monitored by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ISP-OES) on a Prodigy Plus spectrometer. The following characteristic wavelengths of radiation of Yb and Lu atoms were chosen: ytterbium 289.138 and 369.419 nm; lutetium 291.139 and 302.054 nm. Extraction tests were carried out in 15 mL test tubes with a volume. The phases were in contact for 5 min. Reextraction of Lu and Yb from the organic phase was carried out with 5 M HNO3 solutions. Before taking the back extract for analysis, the samples were centrifuged to completely separate the aqueous and organic phases. Then the ytterbium and lutetium concentrations in the back extracts were determined.

Context:  phase and to Eq. (2), as well as indirectly conﬁ rms the participation of P507 dimer molecules in the formation of compounds with REE. It is known that the use of heavy ﬂ uorinated diluents, for example, F3, also leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients; therefore, it was of interest to study the eﬀ ect of this diluent on the REE extraction with P507 solutions. The nature of the relationship between the REE distribution coeﬃ cients and the HNO3 concentration in the extraction of Yb and Lu with P507 solutions in F3 does not depend on the nature of the diluent (Fig. 3), however, the inﬂ uence of the solvation mechanism starts to manifest itself somewhat earlier (from 3 M HNO3) than in the case of extraction with Р507 solutions in isopar M. The curve of the distribution coeﬃ cients of ytterbi- um and lutetium vs. the P507 concentration in isopar-M constructed in logarithmic coordinates (Fig. 4) have a linear form with a slope close to 2, and not to 3, which may be a consequence of an increase in the degree of association of extractant molecules with a growth in its concentration. This fact leads to a decrease in the REE extraction constants with a rise in the P507 concentra- tion (Table 1). The concentration equilibrium constants of Eq. (5) turned out to be the same for isopar M and F3, therewith for lutetium they turned out to be lower than for ytterbium.

Context:  It is known that the use of bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) as an extractant instead of P507 leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients by approximately 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining high values of the separation factors [20, 21]. Therefore, it was of interest to study the regularities of Yb and Lu extraction with solutions of Cyanex-272 in isopar M. In contrast to the system with P507, the functions of the logarithms of the Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration at a concentration of less than 1 M in this system have a slope of about –2.5 (Fig. 6), which results in the need to apply for simulation of the REE extraction in this region not only Eq. (2), but also Eq. (8) derived from Eq. (1) at m = 2 and n = 1:

Context: With increasing the acid concentration in the aqueous phase above 3 M, the REE extraction brings about an increase in the distribution coeﬃ cients, which can be due to a gradual transition to the solvate mechanism of extraction. At the same time, with an increase in the concentration of Cyanex-272, the slope of the ascending section of the function of the distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the HNO3 concentration diminishes (Fig. 6), which can be described by Eqs. (5) and (9) derived from Eq. (1) at m = 1 and n = 2:

Context:  Extraction systems for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium based on acidic organophosphorus extractants P507 and Cyanex-272 from nitric acid solutions have been studied. In the course of the experiments, results were found both with the use of a light diluent (Isopar M) and a heavy diluent F3. The separation factors of lutetium and ytterbium in the studied extraction systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained experimental data on the extraction of lutetium and ytterbium with P507 were used to construct a mathematical model that makes it possible to predict the behavior of Yb and Lu in the extraction cascade. A special report will be devoted to testing technological regimes for the lutetium and ytterbium separation.
