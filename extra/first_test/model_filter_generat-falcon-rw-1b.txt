Context: Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) such as trialkyl phosphates and trialkylphosphine oxides can be used as extractants. Trialkyl phosphates are well known as eﬀ ective extractants and are used for recovering many acids and salts, whereas trialkylphosphine oxides have been studied in this respect to a lesser extent, and their extracting and separating power is of large interest. To reach the maximum eﬃ cient isotope separation by liquid extraction in a multistep process, the substance distribution ratio should be as close to 1 as possible. The distribution ratio D is described by the equation

Context:  Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly inﬂ uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetraﬂ uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances. Boric acid as a weak acid cannot be eﬃ ciently extracted into the organic phase without additional complexation; therefore, tartaric acid is added to aqueous boric acid solutions. Tartaric acid converts boric acid into a complex that is a stronger acid interacting with the extractant more eﬃ ciently. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid does not require such additives. It is interesting to consider organophosphorus compounds as extractants. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is one of the most readily available and widely used commercial extractants. Along with TBP, mixed trialkylphosphine oxide Cyanex 923 is used for the recovery of metal ions. Despite their wide use for the extraction of metal cations, there are few data on extraction of boron-containing acids with them. Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) were studied as extractants for acids structurally similar to HBF4, i.e., for monobasic complex metal-containing acids HMHal4, where М is a metal and Hal is a halogen. The data presented in review [5] show that compounds of metals in oxidation state (III) (such as Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III)) are extracted in the organic phase to form ion pairs consisting of solvated proton and metal-containing anion. HBF4 can be assumed to be extracted by OPCs by a similar mechanism. Mishra et al. [6] report the results of the extraction of HFeCl4 with tributyl phosphate (D = 3–8) and mixed trialkylphosphine oxides Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 (D = 2–8). Khoroshilov and Ivanov [4] studied the boric acid– TBP extraction system in the context of separation of boron isotopes. They obtained the single-stage isotope separation factor α = 1.0067 ± 0.0035 at 20–22°С. In this system, 10В was concentrated in the organic phase.

Context:  The synthesis and study of the properties of superheavy elements (SHE) is one of the fundamental areas of modern nuclear physics. Research in this area is being actively carried out both in Russia and in nuclear centers of other countries (Germany, Japan, USA). Thanks to the work performed at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (Dubna) and RIAR, nuclear- physical properties of new elements with serial numbers 115, 116, and 118 were synthesized and examined. These nuclides were prepared by irradiating targets based on highly enriched isotopes 243Am, 248Cm and 249Cf with 48Ca ions. Target materials are subject to high requirements for purity, as well as the content of radioactive impurities, which include Pu, Am, Cm, Cf isotopes and ﬁ ssion products. RIAR has an active production of 243Am and 248Cm radioactive materials [1]. Americium-243 is recovered from irradiated Pu by separation and precipitation methods [2, 3]. Curium-248 is recovered from aged 252Cf by extraction chromatography using HDEHP-based sorbents. As a rule, trace amounts

Context: of impurities, including Cf and Pu isotopes, ﬁ ssion products, and corrosion products of construction substances (stainless steel), remain in the materials after standard puriﬁ cation methods. For preparing materials of pure transplutonium ele- ments (TPE), ion exchange is widely used in radiochem- ical practice. In ion exchange chromatography, the sepa- ration is based on the selectivity of the ion exchange resin with respect to the counterions of the mixture. When separating ions with very similar properties [for example, rare earth elements (REE)], most ion exchange resins exhibit almost the same aﬃ nity relative to ions close to each other. Separation of rare-earth elements by elution from a column containing a cation exchange resin with a solution of a strong, non-chelating acid is practically impossible, since their distribution coeﬃ - cients diﬀ er little from each other [4]. If you choose a chelating agent that, with the ions of the mixture gives complex compounds of various strengths, then success- ful separation of the ions becomes possible. The stron- ger the complex formed in solution by the counterion, the less this ion will be absorbed by the ion exchange resin. Thus, the separation completeness of the mixture

Context:  components can be enhanced. The chelating reagent α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (α-HIBA) and its salts (main- ly ammonium) are used in ion-exchange processes of intra- and intergroup separation of REE and TPE radio- nuclides of [5–17]. Cation exchange methods are used to separate REE and TPE radionuclides by elution with solutions containing α-HIBA and its salts. Strongly acidic styrene–divinylbenzene sulfonic cation exchange resins, such as Dowex 50W-X8, Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8, and a number of their other analogues, are utilized as sorbents [6, 10, 12–16]. As a rule, in the technique used [5, 6, 9–12], trivalent actinides are ﬁ rst adsorbed from a dilute (<0.5 M) HNO3 solution on a cation exchange + form, resin. Then the sorbent is converted into the NH4 and the actinides are eluted with a chelating reagent (α-HIBA). It was noted in [8, 14] that, without prelimi- nary conversion of the cation exchange resin to the am- monium form by eluating with an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, the released H+ ions have a strong inhibi- tory eﬀ ect on poorly sorbed elements, such as Cf. Anion exchange chromatography using a strongly basic anionite Bio-Rad AG X8 was chosen as a method for purifying Am, Cm from Pu impurities. According to the literature data, Pu(IV) sorption on strongly basic anion exchange resins is possible from nitric acid and hydrochloric acid media [18–20]. In nitric acid media, Pu(IV) can be sorbed starting from 1 M HNO3, 2– therewith the maximum concentration of the Pu(NO3)6 anion is reached at 7.7 M HNO3 [18]. Sorption of Pu on anion exchange resins is also possible from high concentration HCl solutions. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Pu(IV) increases monotonically with a rise in the HCl concentration and, starting from a 9 M concentration, exceeds 1 × 103 [19]. Under these conditions, Am(III) and Cm(III) are not retained by the sorbent. This work was aimed at developing regimes for the puriﬁ cation of Cm and Am from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as developing the regimes for the separation of Am and Cm and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by ion exchange chromatography.

Context:  for puriﬁ cation of Am/Cm from Pu and Fe. The initial solution was a mixture of radionuclides 59Fe(III), 240Pu(IV), 241Am(III), 244Cm(III) in 9 M HCl. To stabilize plutonium in the +4 oxidation state, H2O2 was added to the solution to a concentration of 0.1 M. The initial solution (5 column volumes, hereinafter c.v.) was fed to a column with a Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 sorbent (50–100 mesh) in the Cl– form (1 cm3column) at a rate of 1 mL/(cm2 min), then washed with 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2. Experimental procedure for the separation of Am and Cm and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu. The initial solution was a mixture of 241Am(III), 244Cm(III), 249Cf(III), and 152Eu(III) radionuclides in 0.1 M HNO3. The initial solution (1 c.v.) was fed to a column with a Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 sorbent (200–400 mesh) in the + form (10 cm3 column) at a rate of 1 mL/(cm2 min), NH4 then washed 0.1 M HNO3 and water. Desorption of the studied radionuclides was carried out with solutions of α-HIBA ammonium salt at various concentrations (0.1– 0.2 M), but with a ﬁ xed pH value (pH 5.0). This pH value was chosen based on the results reported in [5, 7]. Analysis methods. The volumetric activity of γ-emitting radionuclides (241Am, 59Fe, 249Cf, 152Eu) Fig. 1.

Solutions of 1.00 mL in glass test tubes 12 mm in diameter were used as sources for measurements. The total activity of α-emitting radionuclides was measured using a Quantulus 1220 liquid scintillation counter. An Aspect α-spectrometer with a semiconductor detector based on an ion-implanted Si single crystal coated with an opaque Al layer was used to measure the contribution of individual nuclides to the total α-activity. The activity of the α-emitting radionuclide 244Сm was measured with an ESBS-7x α-spectrometer. Sources for measurement were prepared by depositing an aliquot of the measured solution on a metal substrate, drying under a lamp, and calcining to remove the salt layer.

Context:  where V is the volume of the sorbent layer (1 c.v.); VAꞌ is the reduced retention volume of substance A, c.v.; VM is dead volume, c.v. The dead volume VM required to calculate the volume distribution ratio includes the free volume of the column and the volume of communications between the eluent injection point and the column.

Context:  The results in Tables 1–4 show that with an increase in the α-HIBA concentration at the second stage of the stepwise elution process, the width of the chromato- graphic peak at the base diminishes and the number of theoretical plates rises, i.e., peak blurring is reduced. At the same time, the selectivity α and the resolution RS de- crease, i.e., the overlapping degree of chromatographic peaks increases. It was noted in [25] that two substances will be separated if the selectivity α > 1; for a satisfac- tory separation, RS must be equal to 1. The separation is considered complete if RS is equal to or greater than 1.5. Therefore, the Cm and Am separation, as well as their puriﬁ cation from Eu and Cf, is recommended to be carried out by stepwise elution with 0.1 M (pH 5.0) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the ﬁ rst and second stage, respectively.

The radiometric methods used in this work show no Pu isotopes in the initial solution (the Pu content is below the detection limits), so the preliminary Pu separation on an anion exchange resin was not performed. A mixture of 248Cm, 241Am, and 249Cf radionuclides was separated on a column containing 10 cm3 of strongly acid Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange + form. The geometrical resin (200–400 mesh) in the NH4 parameters of the column are similar to the parameters

Context:  of the columns used when working with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am. The order of elution and the concentrations of α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions are similar to those used in experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am (Fig. 3). The content of 248Cm and 241Am and their distribution by fractions are shown in the output elution curves (Fig. 4). On the output elution curve of 248Cm (Fig. 4), the leading edge is more diﬀ use than in experiments with indicator amounts of this element (Fig. 3). Based on the data in [10], this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the distribution coeﬃ cient of Cm probably increases with a rise in its concentration. The relation- ship between the amount of a substance sorbed from the liquid phase and its concentration in this phase at a con- stant temperature is expressed by the sorption isotherm.

Context:  The total amount of 203Pb before and after separa- tion was determined in all cases by the region of inter- est (ROI) values. The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods. The irradiation yield is 2.2 mCi μA–1 h–1.

Context: The targeted alpha-therapy in nuclear medicine frequently uses the 225Ac that undergoes the fast alpha- decays [1–3]. This isotope is obtained by diﬀ erent methods, including that in which thorium targets are irradiated with high-energy protons. However, this method does not ﬁ nd wide application because the number of suitable accelerators in the world is exceedingly small, which gives rise to problems with the availability of the given isotope [4]. In addition, 225Ac is not quite convenient for pre-clinical trials because of emitting gamma photons in low yield (not more tham 1% at 100 keV). At the same time, the gamma-emitting isotope 228Ac (T1/2 = 6.1 h) is present in the radioactive decay series of natural thorium as a product formed in the decay of a mother isotope 228Ra and can be isolated in the radiochemically pure form. To advantages of 228Ac, isolated from 228Ra belong the long lifetime of

Context: the mother nuclide (T1/2 = 5.7 yrs) and the absence of long-lived daughter nuclide. The activity of 228Ra in the secular equilibrium with 232Th is about 1.6 kBq per gram of thorium nitrate. Therefore, with 228Ra isolated from gram amounts of thorium nitrate, 228Ac can be dayly extracted from the generator with activity suﬃ cient for carrying out studies, including those performed in vivo (several and tens of kBq). Various ways to separate Th, Ra, and Ac are known from the literature [4–10]. 228Ra and 232Th are, as a rule, separated via coprecipitation of radium and its extraction in various systems [4, 5]. Actinium and radium are separated by ion-exchange chromatography [6, 7], extraction [8], selective sorption [9], and extraction chromatography [4, 6,10]. In these studies, small amounts of 232Th or trace amounts of 229Th have been used. At the same time, there is no published information about isolation of 228Ac from large amounts of 232Th (tens of grams).

Context: Development of a procedure for separation of radiochemically pure 228Ac from natural thorium. It was shown that 228,232Th is extracted with HDEHP from a 4 M HNO3 solution nearly quantitatively (99%), with no 228Ra extracted in this case. An additional puriﬁ cation of 228Ra remaining in the aqueous phase to remove thorium was performed by its passing through a column with extraction-chromatographic sorbent LN, with 99.9% 228Ra and not more than 0.01% 228,232Th contained in the eluate. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by the extraction-chromatographic method on the RE sorbent. It can be seen in Fig. 2, which shows a chromatogram, that 228Ra is quantitatively extracted in 2–5-mL fractions and 228Ac in 13–16-mL fractions. The ﬂ ow rate of the eluate was 1 mL/min, which makes it possible to separate 228Ra and 228Ac in 20 min. It was

Context:  disappearance of its physical component, but positively aﬀ ects the strength of binding between the conjugate and actinium in a solution of BSA in PBS. Interpretation of changes of this kind is diﬃ cult for GO and GO-H, and a further study of the 228Ac sorption mechanism on these samples is necessary. As for the interaction of 228Ac with CNTs, two mechanisms are probably operative in the sorption: sorption of ions within the tube hollows, as shown previously in [32], and the physical sorption on impurity metals (Table 1) contained at tube ends. In the hydrogenation, of CNTs, the catalyst is removed, which can account for the decrease in the total amount of sorption and the increase in the stability against desorption. To conclude, it can be noted that all the CNMs are promising for application in nuclear medicine as a carrier for actinium. In the case of limited amounts of radioactive isotopes of actinium, it is appropriate to use DNDs, GO, and CNTs for which the sorption is nearly quantitative, whereas DND-COOH, GO-H, and CNT-H are the most suitable for in vivo studies, For these the amount of desorption in 3 h does not exceed 5% in solutions of a model biological medium, whereas for the commercial CNMs under study it is about of 40%.

Context:  Synthesis of 125I-atorvastatin was carried out by direct electrophilic substitution with no-carrier-added 125I (T1/2 = 60 days) under oxidative conditions in the presence of CAT. The presumable reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The TLC results show that radioiodide stayed near the origin (Rf = 0–0.1), while 125I-atorvastatin proceeded with the solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1). The radiolabeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.4% (n = 5). It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the puriﬁ cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin. These products might be accumulated in non-target organs. As we found, 125I-atorvastatin was stable for up to 24 h. The lipophilicity was determined by measuring the distribution of 125I-atorvastatin between n-octanol and

Figure 4 shows how the 125I-atorvastatin yield depends on the reaction time in the range from 1 to 60 min. The labeling yield increased with time, reaching 94.3% in 30 min. An increase in the reaction time beyond 30 min led to a small decrease in the radiochemical yield due to side oxidative reactions, whereas shorter reaction time is apparently insuﬃ cient for CAT to fully react with iodide ions and generate the iodonium ions. water. The experimental log P of the labeled molecule (5.9 ± 0.3) was found to be higher than that of atorvastatin (5.4), which may be due to the attachment of iodine. Therefore, atorvastatin is eluted before radioiodinated atorvastatin on reversed-phase HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 1). The lipophilic characteristics of 125I-atorvastatin are important for predicting the uptake and excretion pathways, as hydrophobic radiopharmaceuticals are generally extracted via the hepatobiliary pathway (eﬃ ciently taken up from the blood by the liver, excreted into the bile, and stored by the gallbladder) and slightly via the renal route as it was demonstrated from the in vivo biodistribution studies. The structural and physicochemical link between the hydrophilic and lipophilic functional groups in 125I-atorvastatin is involved in the assessment of the binding aﬃ nity for hepatic transport proteins, the eﬃ cacy of their hepatocyte uptake, and the elimination rate.

Context: An eﬃ cient procedure was developed for selective radioiodination of atorvastatin via direct electrophilic substitution at ambient temperature in the presence of an appropriate oxidant, chloramine-T. The product showed good radiochemical stability and metabolic stability in vivo. The biodistribution studies carried out in mice expressed the aﬃ nity of 125I-atorvastatin for hepatic cells. 125I-labeled atorvastatin behaves as a lipophilic compound, is extracted by liver on hepatocytes, and is excreted into the bile duct and ﬁ nally into the intestine. The maximum liver uptake occurs approximately within 30 min after the injection. 125I-atorvastatin clears predominantly by the hepatobiliary pathway.

Context:  In order to make 64Cu via the nuclear reaction of 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu, we made the enriched 64Ni targets on a gold (Au) disk by electrodeposition of 64Ni from an aqueous solution of 2+ at pH = 9.05, using a robust, reliable and user-friendly apparatus (Figure 1). The Au Ni(NH3)6 disk (30.8 mm diameter × 1.5 mm thickness) was used as a cathode, and a platinum wire was used as an anode. A cavity of 12.1 mm diameter and 0.2 mm depth was milled into the Au disk and 64Ni (99.32%) was plated into this cavity. The 64Ni electroplating was performed with a constant current of 15–25 mA at 2.4–2.6 V in the aqueous solution for 48–72 h. During the electrodeposition, the green color of the 64Ni plating solution gradually faded away and the bubbling of H2 gas was clearly visible. When the 64Ni plating solution became colorless, the electrodeposition was ﬁnished. The absence of Ni2+ was also conﬁrmed by analytical test strips. After cleaning and drying, the plated 64Ni on Au-disk was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, assuming a uniform thickness on the disk.

It was established that the increase in the 106Ru speciﬁ c activity in the MNUP SNF samples is ahead of the growth in the fuel burn-up depth. With increasing the burn-up depth by 23%, the 106Ru speciﬁ c activity increased by 52%. This experimental fact requires additional veriﬁ cation. Iodine isotopes were not detected in any of the dissolution apparatus traps, nor in the initial solution, nor in the condensate obtained to determine the tritium speciﬁ c activity. According to the calculations performed using the SCALE 4.4А package, the 129I speciﬁ c activity in the MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor with a burn-up of 70 MW day/kg (Uref) and holding after irradiation for 2 years should be 2.93 × 109 Bq/t, the remaining iodine isotopes either are absent or are contained in negligibly small amounts, for example, the 131I content is 6.5 × 10–11 Bq/t. Taking into account the weight of the analyzed SNF sample irradiated as part of KETVS-1, in the 200 mL initial solution, the calculated content of 129I should

Context: Radiopharmaceuticals are clinically useful for the diagnosis and treatment of dis- ease [1–5]. However, quantifying radiopharmaceuticals’ dosimetry is challenging [6]. Matching diagnostic radionuclides with chemically similar therapeutics creates a “thera- nostic” pair, helping to resolve this problem [7]. The success of theranostic pairs has led to the re-evaluation of several radionuclides as potential radiopharmaceuticals, with the most popular in recent times being gallium-68 (t1/2 = 68 min, β+ = 89%, Emax= 1899 keV) and lutetium-177 (t1/2 = 6.7 d, Eβ- = 134 keV) [8]. The availability of both gallium-68 and lutetium-177 and the success of conjugating a myriad of targeting vectors to them have led to their widespread adoption in the nuclear medicine community. However, several short- comings exist for these two radionuclides; namely, the short half-life of gallium-68 limits the range of its applicability, and the resistance of some cancers to lutetium-177-labelled radiopharmaceuticals has prompted a search for other therapeutic radionuclides [9]. Addi- tionally, although gallium-68 and lutetium-177 have been used as a theranostic pair, slight chemical differences between the two may complicate dosimetric calculations and/or lead to subtle biological incongruities [10]. Using compounds labelled with the same chemical element can obviate this problem and allow the same protocols to be used in forming and purifying chemical complexes [11]. Cobalt-55 (t1/2 = 17.53 h, β+ = 77%, Eγ = 931.1 keV, Iγ = 75%) and cobalt-58m (t1/2 = 9.10 h, IC= 100%) are one of the most promising of such pairs identiﬁed due to their identical chemical properties coupled to similar half-lives and high in vivo stability and compatibility with many chelators which can be coupled with tar-

Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradi- ation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

Context:  The highest-yielding reaction routes for relatively common cyclotrons with dual particle capabilities use proton or deuteron bombardment on iron targets. Cobalt-58m can be produced via the (p,n) reaction on iron-58, which has a natural isotopic abundance of 0.3%. Measured data for the excitation functions 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 58Fe(p,n)58gCo (t1/2 = 70.9 d, β+ = 14.94%, Eave β+ = 475 keV) are shown in Figure 2 below.

Context: In Figure 2, “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the iso- mer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. The isomers cobalt-58m and cobalt-58g are co-produced in any charged particle irradiation. While the production of cobalt-58g is unavoidable, other radioiso- topic impurities can be reduced with careful modulation of proton energies and target material enrichments. The 58Fe(p,2n)57Co (t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 122.1 keV, Iγ = 85.6%) and 58Fe(p,3n)56Co (t1/2 = 77.2 d, β+ = 19.5%, Eγ= 846.8 keV, Iγ = 99.9%) nuclear reactions have a higher energy threshold than 58Fe(p,n)58Co, seen in Table 1 below [40].

Context:  beam captures the maximum of the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo excitation function while minimizing the radioisotopic impurity-producing reactions. Figure 3. Previously reported excitation functions for (a) 58Fe(p,2n)57Co and (b) 58Fe(p,3n)56Co, measured using isotopically enriched targets [32]. Irradiating isotopically enriched iron-58 avoids the production of other impurities that cannot be separated out in the downstream chemistry. Natural iron is composed of iron-54 (5.8%), iron-56 (91.7%), iron-57 (2.2%), and iron-58 (0.3%). Proton bombardment of iron-54 leads to the production of very short-lived contaminants such as 54Fe(p,n)54Co (t1/2 = 1.46 m) and 54Fe(p,2n)53Co (t1/2 = 0.24 s) that do not diminish the radioisotopic purity of cobalt-58m. However, higher-energy proton reactions on iron-56 and iron-57, as described above for iron-58, may form longer-lived radioisotopic impurities cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Measured data from the relevant excitation functions are shown below in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4. Measured excitation functions for 56Fe(p,n)56Co (a) and 56Fe(p,2n)55Co (b) [32,33,41–45]. These data are in agreement with measured data for production of cobalt-56 up to the threshold of the 57Fe(p,2n)56Co reaction and for production of cobalt-55 up to the threshold of the 57Fe(p,3n)55Co reaction using natural Fe targets [35,36,38,39,44,46–55].

Context:  Figure 6. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-58m,g from deuteron bombardment on natural iron targets. While 57Fe(d,n)58Co reaction is the dominant one, according to Su- dar et al., 56Fe(d,γ)58Co and 58Fe(d,2n)58Co data also contribute to the measured excitation functions [29,58–62]. Figure 7. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-57 from the 57Fe(d,2n) and 56Fe(d,n) nuclear reactions [58,59,61–65]. In Figure 7, an energy of 14.4 MeV is used as a cutoff to remove any data possibly acquired from 58Fe(d,3n)57Co reactions (threshold energy of 14.4 MeV). However, the threshold energy for 57Fe(d,2n)57Co is 3.9 MeV, and therefore it is difﬁcult to differentiate between the production via the 56Fe(d,n) and 57Fe(d,2n) reactions [40].

Context:  Though the proton- and deuteron-induced reactions are most accessible to the majority of modern cyclotrons, there are alternative routes utilizing helium-4 ions, neutrons, or helium-3 nucleus with comparable cross sections [75–77]. Alpha beams afford a particularly attractive reaction route using monoisotopic manganese targets via 55Mn(α,n)58mCo. The measured excitation functions are shown below in Figure 12a. If higher-energy alpha beams are used, cobalt-57 can be formed from 55Mn(α,2n), as shown in Figure 12b. To decrease the likelihood of producing this contaminant, lower- energy beams should be employed to capture the greatest cross section for the 55Mn(α,n)58Co reaction while minimizing the 55Mn(α,2n)57Co reaction.

Context:  Figure 12. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-58 from (α,n) reaction (a) and cobalt-57 (b) on manganese- 55 [29,30,32,35,78–84]. In addition to charged particle-induced reactions, several alternative and less prag- matic routes to cobalt-58m can be contemplated, e.g., quasi-monoenergetic neutron or triton irradiations. Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons can be produced via 2H(d,n)3He re- action on hydrogen-2 gas targets. The neutrons bombard nickel or cobalt induce the 58Ni(n,p)58mCo and 59Co(n,2n)58mCo reactions [29,75]. Tritons can be generated via the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction within a nuclear reactor with an energy of 2.736 MeV. These ions go on to bombard [56Fe]Fe2O3 targets to produce cobalt-58m,g via the 56Fe(t,n)58mCo reaction route [76,85]. These alternative reactions currently rely on rare accelerator infrastructure or on signiﬁcantly increased scale in terms of beam intensities. Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations. These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts. A com- parison of the experimentally determined thick target yields and theoretical yields are shown in Figures 13–16. Figure 13. Thick target yield comparison between theoretical data and experimentally collected data for iron-54 targets at (a) 8.2 MeV and (b) 12 MeV [26,86,87].

Context:  Figure 16. Thick target yield comparison between theoretical data and experimentally collected data for iron-58 targets at 10.1 MeV [87]. As mentioned above, the co-production of cobalt-58g with cobalt-58m is unavoidable. Valdovinos et al. determined that through the 57Fe(d,n)58gCo production route, cobalt-58g has an experimental yield of 131.5 ± 19.7 KBq/µA-h at 8.2 MeV with integrated currents ranging from 90 to 124 µA-h [26]. This impurity poses an issue to the application of cobalt- 58m due its long half-life and concomitant gamma emissions [88]. However, cobalt-58g can be useful for PET imaging of the biodistribution of radiolabeled agents. This potentially allows for determination of these agents’ biodistribution at timepoints many days after injection [89]. A summary of the discussed pragmatic production methods is shown in Table 2 below, highlighting the isotope produced, material needed with respective natural abundance, the reaction that must occur, and the possible radio-contaminants that may be co-produced.

Context: Targets of nickel and iron are relatively easy to fabricate; most literature reports describe electrochemical preparations because of the thermal and electrical conductivity of the resulting metal deposits, and presumably due to their compatibility with efforts to reuse costly separated materials. Nickel powder, natural or enriched, can be plated onto a silver or gold backings via electrodeposition with ﬁnal deposited nickel masses between 45 and 200 mg [14,26]. The procedure follows closely to the methods for plating nickel-64 for the production of copper- 64 [90,91]. In a generally representative process, nickel-58 powder is dissolved in 6 M HNO3, dried and reconstituted in 2.3 mL of 2.4 M H2SO4. The plating solution is adjusted pH 9 using 28% NH4OH and 270–300 mg of (NH4)2SO4 and transferred to a circular elec- troplating cell that consists of a Teﬂon base that is connected to the gold coin, allowing for a 5 mm plating diameter [26]. With graphite or platinum anodes, a DC voltage of 2.5–3.6 V is applied, producing currents ranging from 8 to 116 mA. Masses of 45–55 mg are deposited in ~12 h and larger masses (100–200 mg) take 2–3 days to quantitatively electroplate onto the cathode [14,26] leaving a clear and colorless electrolyte behind. Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 µL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell. Thisgaard et al. explains a different method for electroplating iron powder, adapted from Zaman and Qaim [28]. In this method, iron powder is dissolved in 1 mL of H2SO4 under nitrogen-atmosphere. once dissolved, the solution is diluted with distilled water to 5 mL in order to have a pH of 1.5. This solution is then used for the plating process on a silver backing, where the current density is reported as 28–35 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h with a ﬁxed voltage of 7.3 V. [87]. Another form of target fabrication is to press elemental enriched iron into 5 mm diameter pellets. Enriched iron material can come in the form of Fe2O3. If made from the oxide form, the target will have poor thermal conductivity. Therefore, the enriched Fe2O3 is reduced to elemental form by heating the powder at 800 ◦C for 4 h in a hydrogen tube furnace [86].

Context:  (NODAGA tagged) [121]. In vitro and in vivo up uptake waweres evaluated in the KB cervical cancer cell line which expresses high levels of FR [122]. The two agents had similar uptake and biodistributions, achieving >15% ID/g in xenografted tumors and underwent renal clearance [121]. Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu- labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124]. Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of speciﬁcity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difﬁcult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.

Context: Abstract—The possibility of producing 225Ac and 223Ra by irradiation of natural 232Th with medium-energy protons was examined. Thorium foils were irradiated with 90-, 110-, and 135-MeV protons at the accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Troitsk (Moscow oblast). The cumulative production cross sections for 225Ac were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, and for 227Th (223Ra precursor), 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. Based on the experimental data and theoretical calculations, the possible yields of 225Ac and 223Ra in irradiation of thick thorium targets at various accelerators were deter- mined. An efficient procedure was suggested for isolating the products from the irradiated targets: 225Ac, by liquid extraction and extraction chromatography, and 223Ra, by sublimation from a thorium–lanthanum melt followed by thermochromatographic separation in metallic titanium columns and extraction-chromatographic isolation of radium. The procedure allows production of large (units of curies) amounts of radiochemically pure 225Ac and 223Ra, which is promising for wide use of these radionuclides in nuclear medicine.

Context:  Actinium-225 (T1/2 = 10.0 days) is one of the most promising α-emitting radionuclides for therapy of vari- ous tumor diseases [1, 2]. It is also promising to use this radionuclide in generators as a source of the daughter short-lived 213Bi (T1/2 = 46 min). Various methods for 225Ac production are known [3]. Usually this radionuclide is isolated from products of 233U decay following the scheme 233U (T1/2 = 1.6 × 105 years) → 229Th (T1/2 = 7340 years) → 225Ra (T1/2 = 14.8 days) → 225Ac [4, 5]. Difficult availability of the starting 233U restricts the possibility of producing large amounts of 225Ac. 229Th, from which 225Ac is di- rectly isolated, can also be produced from 230Th (T1/2 = 75 400 years) by irradiation with fast neutrons or γ-quanta [6]. The starting 230Th is a member of the 238U radioactive series, and its content is about 20 g per ton of uranium, i.e., this material is also difficultly avail- able.

Context: targets by their irradiation with fast or thermal neu- trons [7, 8], γ-quanta [9], or accelerated protons or other charged particles [10, 11]. The starting 226Ra is also difficultly available. In addition, radium targets of relatively large mass are dangerous in handling, which gives rise to serious problems in their wide application, especially in cases when radium regeneration from the irradiated targets is required. Another radionuclide promising for medicine is 223Ra (T1/2 = 11.4 days). It is directly used for therapy of bone tumor diseases [12]. It can also serve as a source of 211Pb (T1/2 = 36 min) in generators [13]. The common route to small amounts of 223Ra is its isolation from 235U decay products. Large amounts of 223Ra can be produced by irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reac- tor, followed by chemical isolation of the formed 227Ac (T1/2 = 21.8 years) decaying into 227Th (T1/2 = 18.7 days) and then into 223Ra. As already noted, irra- diation and processing of a radium target involve seri- ous problems.

Context: Fig. 1. Scheme of 225Ac isolation from irradiated thorium target. We believe that the most promising route of pro- duction of 225Ac, 223Ra, and some other important ra- dionuclides is irradiation of natural 232Th targets with medium-energy protons, followed by product isolation. In the early 1960s, Lefort et al. experimentally meas- ured the production cross sections of 225Ac and 223Ra from 232Th at a proton energy of 150 MeV [14], and Gauvin measured the 225Ac production cross sections at proton energies in the range 43–115 MeV [15]. Also, 232Th was irradiated with the aim of 225Ac pro- duction with 660-MeV protons at an accelerator in Dubna [16] and with 600-MeV protons at an accelera- tor in CERN [17]. The possibility of producing 225Ac from thorium by its irradiation with protons of the en- ergy lower than 40 MeV was noted recently [18], but no experimental data confirming this assumption were presented. On the whole, only limited information is available on optimization of production of various ra- dionuclides from a thorium target and on radiochemi- cal procedures for isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from irradiated Th and on their purification to remove other radionuclides. Up to now, 225Ac and 223Ra were not actually produced by this procedure. The major goal of this study was measuring the 225Ac and 223Ra production cross sections in reactions of Th with 90–135-MeV protons with the aim to opti- mize the conditions for production of large amounts of these radionuclides on the proton beam of the Moscow Meson Factory [Institute for Nuclear Research (INR), Russian Academy of Sciences, Troitsk]. In the course of our study, we developed efficient radiochemical procedures for isolating Ac and Ra in the radiochemi- cally pure state. It can be expected that wide use of 225Ac and 223Ra in medicine will allow in the future cardinal solution of the problem of treating many tu- mor diseases. Th irradiation. In irradiation experiments we used 10 × 10 mm2 pieces of 5-μm-thick Th metal foil. The foils were irradiated with a beam of accelerated pro- tons of energy 128, 143, and 158 MeV at the linear accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Rus- sian Academy of Sciences [19], at a beam current of approximately 5 μA. In the course of irradiation, tho- rium foils wrapped in aluminum foil were intensely cooled with a water flow. To decrease the proton en- ergy to 90, 110, and 135 MeV, graphite absorbers were arranged before the target. The accuracy in the proton energy determination was approximately ±2.5 MeV. The uncertainty was determined by the accelerator pa- rameters and by proton scattering as a result of their absorption by graphite and cooling water. The proton flux was monitored with Al and Cu foils by production of 22Na and 62Zn, respectively, whose production cross sections are known [20]. The foils after irradiation were withdrawn and sub- jected to γ-ray spectrometric analysis using a spec- trometer equipped with a HPGe detector with a beryl- lium window (Canberra GR 3818). 225Ac isolation.

Irradiated Th metal foils were dissolved in concentrated HNO3, the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 3–8 M HNO3, and Th was extracted with two portions of 1–5 M TBP or 0.1–0.5 M TOPO solution in toluene [21]. After the Th extraction, the aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, concentrated HClO4 was added, and the solu- tion was evaporated to dryness to remove Ru isotopes. For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatogra- phy in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-di- (TRU- isobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) [11, 22]. After washing the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, Ac was eluted with the next 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, and the solu- tion was collected. For complete purification of Ac, the extraction chromatography was performed twice. The radiochemical purity of 225Ac was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry with a semiconductor PIPS detector (Canberra). 223Ra isolation. Chemical isolation of Ra from irra- diated metallic Th was performed by a gas-chemical method. For this purpose, a piece of irradiated thorium foil (3 mg) together with metallic La (280 mg) was placed in a crucible of metallic Zr. Addition of La (Тm = 918°С) leads to formation of a melt with Th (for Th, Тm = 1755°С), and in the liquid metal diffusion and, correspondingly, release of the sublimed micro- elements are considerably faster than in solid Th. The crucible was heated for 1 h in succession at 970, 1040, 1130, 1190, 1270°С in a stream of helium purified with a titanium getter (the heating temperature was determined with an accuracy of ±15°С). Radium and other radionuclides were deposited at the furnace out- let on tantalum collectors in the form of foils which were replaced when changing the heating temperature. In another experiment (Fig. 2), an irradiated tho- rium sample with metallic La was heated for 1 h at 1200 ± 15°С, and the released products were trans- ferred with a helium stream into a thermochroma- tographic column (quartz tube lined with titanium foil from the inside); the sublimed elements were deposited on the Ti surface in different temperature zones. After the heating completion, the titanium foil serving as collector for sublimed products was cut into pieces (corresponding to temperature zones), and the γ-ray spectrum of each piece of the collector was measured. After that, the piece of the collector with the deposited Ra, Ba, and Sr was subjected to further purification by

Thus, the experimentally measured production cross sections are cumulative, and they cannot be accurate, because the production cross sections of the parent 225Th, 225Ra, 229Pa, and 225Ra were not determined sufficiently reliably. Never- theless, these cumulative cross sections allow estima- tion of 225Ac yields in irradiation of targets in different ranges of proton energy. The 225Ac production cross sections that we calcu- lated from γ-ray spectrometric data are plotted in Fig. 4 in comparison with the theoretical values obtained us- ing different models: ALICE (ALICE-IPPE version) and cascade evaporation (СЕF). For the proton ener- gies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, the experimental cross sections were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, respectively. Figure 4 also shows the experimental data obtained previously [14, 15]. Our experimental data lie between the theoretical data calculated by different models and better agree with the previous experimental data reported in [14], rather than in [15]. Figure 5 shows the 225Ac yields that we calculated for a thorium target in relation to its thickness and ini- tial (“inlet”) energy of protons incident on the thick target (the energy of protons leaving the target was taken equal to 40 MeV; below this energy, the 225Ac yield is extremely low). Figure 5 shows the experimen- tal yield curve plotted on the basis of compilation of our data with those reported in [14] (at relatively high energies) and [15] (at lower energies). The yield curve plotted on the basis of theoretical cross section calcula- tions (ALICE-IPPE model) is also given. The values from [15] are in poor agreement with the results of

As can be seen, it is more appropriate to produce 225Ac at proton energies exceeding 100 MeV. On the basis of the available experimental and theo- retical data (Table 2), we calculated the amounts of 225Ac that can be produced in one 10-day irradiation run at various accelerators: in INR, Brookhaven Na- tional Laboratory (USA), Los Alamos National Labo- ratory (USA), TRIUMF (Canada), and Arronax (France). The real beam current attainable at these in- stallations on thorium targets, taking into account the possibilities of their cooling, is given. The proton en- ergy decreases on passing through inlet windows, cool- ing water layer, and target shell, so the energy of pro- tons incident on the target (“inlet” energy) is usually lower by 5–15 MeV than the initial accelerated proton energy. Some installations use multilayer targets for better cooling, and certain energy loss is observed in water gaps between the target layers and in the shells (this loss was taken equal to 10%). The chemical yield was taken equal to 90%. The target was kept after irra- diation for 10 days in the case of 225Ac and 16 days in the case of 223Ra (the best time for accumulation from 227Th). As can be seen, the Ac yield monotonically in- creases with an increase in the proton energy, and effi- cient production is possible by irradiation of a metallic Th target with accelerated protons of the energy ex- ceeding 100 MeV. 227Th production cross sections and 223Ra yields. Theoretical calculations show that the major pathway of 223Ra formation is via α-decay of 227Th (Т1/2 = 18.7 days) produced by the (p,p5n) reaction and via

Apparently, Ra, Ba, Sr, Be, Cs, and Cd are transported along the thermochromatographic column in the ele- mentary state, whereas I and Br form compounds with Ti. As can be seen, by depositing the sublimed ele- ments on the Ti collector in the temperature range 1100–600°С (the range is refined depending on the isolation conditions), it is possible to obtain a fraction of Ra containing only Ва and Sr impurities. The subsequent extraction-chromatographic purifi- cation of this fraction allows us to obtain a fraction of pure Ra containing 223Ra with impurities of 225Ra and 224Ra (Fig. 3c). Thus, we have developed an efficient procedure for isolating 225Ac and 223Ra from metallic Th irradiated with medium-energy accelerated protons.

Context:  Cadmium-109 is used for fabricating reference ion- izing radiation sources. It can be produced by neutron irradiation of silver. In irradiation of the starting material with >98% enrichment for 6 months in the SM reactor with ther- mal neutrons at a flux density of 1 × 1015 n cm–2 s–1, the total yield of all the Cd isotopes is about 50% rela- tive to the initial silver weight; the specific activity of 109Cd is 4–4.2 Ci g–1. The production of the desired radionuclide is accompanied by the production of a significant amount of 110mAg. The subsequent radio- chemical processing of the irradiated sample is per- formed to remove 110mAg from 109Cd, obtain the re- quired chemical form of the product, and regenerate expensive 107Ag for the repeated irradiation. The 110mAg/109Cd activity ratio in the final product should not exceed 3 × 10–4%. Extensive experimental data are available on the separation of Ag and Cd by ion exchange, extraction, and selective precipitation of Ag [1, 2]. The over- whelming majority of methods are methods of analyti- cal chemistry, unsuitable for operation with gram amounts of Ag and Cd in hot cells under the conditions of remote control. Only the precipitation methods based on precipitation of poorly soluble silver halides or of Ag metal after the silver reduction are an excep- tion. We believe that the precipitation of Ag metal, which is a compact readily settling powder that can be readily washed, is the easiest in implementation. This method was used for isolation and purification of 109Cd [3]; silver was precipitated from 0.1–2 M HNO3 in the presence of NaNO3 on SKN carbon sorbent. At equal initial activity of 109Cd and 110mAg, the Cd/Ag separa- tion factor was approximately 500–800. Final purifica- tion of Cd to remove Ag was performed by isotope dilution of Ag, followed by the AgCl precipitation. In contrast to [3], in numerous procedures for re- covering Ag from wastes the reduction, as a rule, is performed in weakly alkaline or ammonia solutions, because specifically in these media it is most complete [4]. This study was aimed at developing a procedure for Cd purification to remove Ag in one process cycle by reduction and precipitation of Ag from ammonia solutions, followed by the Cd concentration in the form convenient for the subsequent preparation of the 109Cd product (hydrochloric acid solution with preset HCl concentration). We chose as reductant hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS), which does not react with Cd. The precipitated Ag metal is the ready starting product for fabricating targets. Then, Cd is precipitated from the mother liquor in the form of basic cadmium carbonate, which is then readily dissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this study, we determined the conditions for the most complete reduction of Ag and precipitation of basic cadmium carbonate from ammonia solutions.

The mass concentration of Ag and Cd was 4–10 mg mL–1. A preset amount of HAS was added to the solution, and the solution was mixed and allowed to stand for 24 h. The mother liquor was separated from the Ag precipitate on a green ribbon paper filter, the precipitate was washed with distilled water, and the wash waters were combined with the mother liquor. The precipitate was dissolved in 4 M HNO3. The content of Cd and Ag in the combined mother liquor and in the solution obtained after dis- solving the Ag precipitate was determined using radio- active tracers. To precipitate basic cadmium carbonate, moist cad- mium nitrate spiked with 109Cd was dissolved in an ammonia buffer solution of the preset composition. The mass concentration of Cd was 4–10 mg mL–1. To this solution, we added a K2CO3 solution to a concen- tration of 0.3 N, mixed, and allowed to stand for 4–6 h.

For the efficient separation of Ag and Cd, it is necessary to find conditions at which Cd would completely occur in the carbonate precipitate and Ag would occur in the solution the ammine complex. Apparently, the minimal concentration of ammonia should be sufficient for dissolving Ag and Cd nitrates with the formation of the corresponding soluble ammine complexes of Ag and Cd. The maximal concentration of ammonia should be so as to allow no less than 95% precipitation of cadmium carbonate.

Context: To take full benefit of excitation function and to avoid the formation of the radionuclidic impurities, the proton entrance energy should be 14 MeV.18,19 The physical thickness of the silver layer is chosen in such way that for a given beam/target angle geometry the particle exit energy should be 5 MeV. According to SRIM code (The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter);25 the thickness has to be 352 µm for 90° geometry. To minimize the thickness of the silver layer, a 6° geometry is preferred, in which case a 35 µm layer is recommended. Silver targets are prepared by DC-CCE (constant current electrolysis) of the metal from alkaline plating solutions. An electrolysis solution is a volume of about 450 ml and a composition of 5.1 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.1 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3, while the current between the electrodes is adjusted to 0.05 A. The silver electroplating was performed in constant current. In 2 hours, a silver target of 36.75 mg.cm–2 thickness is prepared. Prior to the silver plating and to ensure a good adhesion, copper plate was cleaned using sandpaper of 1000 grade followed by rinsing copper plate with deionized water. Non-reactive plating vessels are hollow Perspex cylinders (diameter 6 cm, height 20 cm) fitted with an axial Pt anode wire mounted at the bottom by means of a tube-end fitting with perforated septum.

Context: Cadmium-109 has found application in physiological research on animals and plants for more than forty years informations. This which has provided useful radionuclide can probably be used for inhibition of liver cancerous cells,12,13 as well as for tissue imaging with computed SPECT (single photon tomography).14 Additionally, to investigate the ecosystem.15 emission it can be used The production of 109Cd with a proton beam can be performed by reactions: In+p,16 that needs an energy of about 96 MeV, Ag+d17 with energy 13.4 MeV and Ag+p,18,19 with an energy range between 14 and 9 MeV. Cyclotron is ideal for this work. Accelerator production of 109Cd is largely achieved via nuclear reactions 109Ag(p,n)109Cd and 109Ag(d,2n)109Cd which are well suited for medium to low-energy cyclotrons. Our centre in Karaj employs a Cyclone-30 (IBA, Belgium). Solid targetry systems on these accelerators are made of pure copper backing onto which target materials are electrodeposited. It is noted that silver electrodeposits prepared from nitrate solutions, free of any organic or inorganic additive, are not smooth or compact, regardless of plating condition used. They consist of grains growing independently of each other and under given plating conditions may degenerate as dendrites.20 Since most of the work directed at replacing cyanide in silver plating 0236–5731/USD 20.00 © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest

Context:  Four symmetrical windows (22.36 or 11.69 cm2) on the vertical side wall allow up to four copper targets backing positioning. Each slot is sealed by an O-ring fitted window. The geometrical shape of the slot determines the actual target electrodeposition area. The liquid-tight sealing of the windows is realized by stainless steel mechanical pestles mounted on a PVC ring surrounding plating vessel and by pressing the copper backing against O-ring seal. An external PVC ring is fitted with four supporting pins to hold a motor-stirrer combination in position. The stirrer is a hollow perforated POM cylinder mounted on the axis of a DC motor and surrounding the platinum anode. The stirrer rotation speed is set at 600 rpm; during the process, its rotating direction is reversed after 8 seconds improving deposit homogeneity. To keep the desired temperature at a preset level, a heater (a series of six isolated 1 Ω/W resistors, through which an appropriate DC-current is forced (1.1 A, 40 °C up to 1.8 A, 60 °C) is circularly mounted at the bottom of the vessel. An insulated sensor, introduced through the stirrer support-plate, temperature. As monitors electrolysis to depletion requires long-time (up to 24 hours) plating, evaporation of plating solution occurs. To maintain a constant liquid volume (450 ml), a conductivity glass/graphite sensor monitors the solution level and actuates a peristaltic pump at the required rate, supplying distilled water to compensate evaporation losses. The rack-mounted home-made electronics includes a motor/stirrer control, an adjustable DC voltage generator card and four V/I converters coupled to current boosters.

Context: The freshly prepared solution of silver was poured into the plating vessel. This refined procedure is a result of several repeated experiments with different acidity and compositions of bath, different temperature and electroplating currents. The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined in by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (using a Joel Model JSM 6400 at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV). The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C (the temperature that the Ag layer can experience during a high current irradiation) for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water.

Context:  Since large amount of free cyanide in the bath forms a sedimentary layer on the Ag electrodeposition and consequently reduces the current efficiency, adjusting the quantity of free cyanide in the bath is important.26 On the other hand, less amount of free cyanide reduces the bath conductivity. Hence, the bath compounds should be optimized. According to some publications on concentrations of silver in the bath,21–26 a bath with 10.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 7 g.l–1 KCN and 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 was prepared. The data provided in Table 1 denote a poor current efficiency at high current density but also formation of chalk-white sediment on the Ag deposit. low Because in temperature, high current density and high free hydroxide,27 while application of a very low current density results in a rather poor quality of the deposit, and a very high current density reduces the over voltage of hydrogen and decreases the quality and the current efficiency.28 Hence, an optimal value was expected and investigated.

Context:  The current efficiency was determined at different current densities using DC current at room temperature (Table 1). An optimum DC current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 should be applied. Consequently, further experiments were carried out while using current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2, and changes were applied to the concentrations of bath compounds which consist of 8.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 8.5 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3. After changing the concentrations of the bath, the influence of acidity on current efficiency was concerned in further the experiments. These alternations had stopped undesired production of chalk-white sediment on the surface.

Context: the bath concentrations are held as low as practical considering the requirements of the job. In order to economize, some experiments were carried out with different silver molarities in plating solution. In this work based on the data in Table 5, it seems that the minimum amount of silver in the solution should be 4 g.l–1 to electroplate the layer with 100% current efficiency (Table 4).

Context:  Adjusting the bath acidity is important for the effect of bath efficiency and coating physical properties. A large reduction on acidity causes hydrogen reduction and simultaneously sediment of the basis salts on cathode. After preparing the silver bath (while the pH of bath was about 11) for studying the effects of solution the acidity was acidity on electroplating quality, changed from 8.5 to 13. It is clear that the higher current efficiency and the better electrodeposited layers are available in lower acidity than it is in comparison to electrodeposited layers by higher acidity bath (Table 2).

Context:  After finding the most economic and qualitative bath concentrations, some experiments were carried out for 2 to 10 hours for the solution that contained 5.16 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.16 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 at 24 °C. When the best quality and current efficiency was obtained in these experiments at room temperature and without adding any additives, a suitable molarity of the bath composition produced the current efficiency of 100% (Table 5). To estimate the quality of the electroplated silver targets some criteria had to be taken into account, such as homogeneity, morphology, visual appearance of the silver layer and thermal shock test. The homogeneity of the silver layer is important as it may seriously affect the production rate of 109Ca. This was determined by measuring the thickness of several parts of the layer by a micrometer and calculation of the standard deviation of the data.

Context: As the electrodepositions satisfy thermal shock test, current beam irradiation of higher than 200 µA can be applied. Ag is a precious metal and it is, therefore, essential to be recovered from the processed solution of the radiochemical re-used. The electrodeposition of Ag using cyanide baths gives quite acceptable quality for the irradiation purposes.

Context: 0.2 M Se(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 3.224 g of H2SeO3 in a small portion of distilled water and then was completed to 50 mL. Mixtures with dif- ferent Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios were pre- pared by dropwise addition of the Mo(VI) solution to the stirred Se(IV) solution, followed by dropwise addi- tion of the Zr(IV) solution. Varied volumes of the three solutions were used to obtain different molar ratios. The pH of the solution for preparing the ZSM gel was adjusted to ~5.0 with 2 M Na2CO3. The precipitates formed were digested in the mother solution for 24 h at room temperature before phase separation by centrifu- gation. After separation, the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water until the washing filtrates were free from chloride ions, dried at 50°C for 24 h, and pulverized to the desired particle size.

Context: The chemical composition, particularly the Mo con- tent of the zirconium selenomolybdate gel, is a signifi- cant factor for its use as a column matrix in preparation of gel-type 99Mo/99mTc radioisotope generators. The chemical composition of the obtained zirconium se- lenomolybdate materials was studied radiometrically by dissolving the gel materials prepared from the ra- dioactive solution of 95Zr, 99Mo, and 75Se in a hot con- centrated HCl solution. The table compiles the data on the Mo(VI) precipitation yield, the corresponding equi- librium pH value, and some properties of the formed zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo products at the given Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios. As can be seen, the precipitation yield of Mo(VI) from the Mo(VI)– Se(IV)–Zr(IV) mixed solutions decreased with increas- ing Se concentration. The Mo content decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrices, ZSM-1 > ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. This means that the selectivity of the positively charged zirconia surface to molybdate and/ or selenite anionic species depends on their concentra- tion in the mixed solution. At low selenite concentra- tions, the molybdate anions show higher affinity for the positively charged zirconia surface than the se- 2– anions appreciably con- lenite anions do. The SeO3 tribute to the ZSM structure at low Mo(VI) content to keep the zirconia surface neutral. The relative content of Zr(IV) in the gel matrices decreased as the initial concentration of Se(IV) in the mixed solutions in- creased: ZSM-1> ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. In addition, the weight loss of the precipitates dried at 150 and 200°C to constant weight decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrix. Therefore, ZSM-1 sample of zirconium selenomolybdate was chosen for characteri- zation (via IR, thermal analysis, XRD, and FESEM) and further preparation and quality control of 99Mo/99mTc generator. The suggested formula of the formed gel matrices may be written as ZrO(OH)+· (HSeO3)1–x(HMoO4)x·nH2O [21].

Context:  The energy dependences of the reaction cross section and yield of 186Re in the energy range 12.84/5.85 MeV (energy threshold of the reaction 3.58 MeV) were measured using foil stacks. To determine the integral deuteron beam current, (cid:0)2, we used iron monitors (surface density 16.5 mg cm chemical purity no less than 99.9%) which were ar- ranged along the deuteron beam before and after the tungsten samples [4]. Radiation materials-science studies of cyclotron targets based on isotopically enriched powdered 186W. Preliminary radiation materials-science tests of cyclotron targets were performed on a U-120 cyclo- tron using deuteron beams (initial energy 13 MeV) of various intensities (maximal beam current 8 (cid:6)A, beam power up to 40 W).

Context:  The discovered phenomenon formally resembles the classical emanation of inert gases from crystalline salts [14] and release of volatile fission products from UO2 [15]. It should be emphasized that such processes are observed only in systems with polymorphism. In par- in the Sn:113mIn system the release of the ticular, 113mIn atoms into the gas phase starts in the tempera- ture range of the (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:5) polymorphous transition (from 453 K), and in the Cd:111In system no (cid:3)volatili- zation(cid:4) of impurities is observed even at temperatures (575(cid:0)585 K) [16]. approaching the melting point Studies of the emanation in the Sn:113mIn system also showed that the release of the impurity atoms into the gas phase depends on the nuclear and physicochemical history of the sample, conditions of foil annealing, and composition of the gas medium [10, 11]. As in the case of the Sn:113mIn system, in the W:186Re system we also observed the release of daughter atoms into the gas phase, taking place only in a combination with a polymorphous transition. An- nealing of the irradiated metal at temperatures below the phase transition point (<1000 K) was not accom- panied by the egress of 186Re from the bulk of the metal (these experiments were performed only with

Heating of irradiated W above the polymorphous transition point (>1000 K) was accompanied by the release of 186Re into the gas phase; the release of the impurity atoms from the bulk of the metal became more active with an increase in the oxygen content in the medium in the course of heat treatment of the targets. In particular, when the irradiated cyclotron (cid:0)4 torr, the release of (cid:0)5(cid:0)10 targets were annealed at 10 (cid:0)2 torr it did not (cid:0)3(cid:0)10 186Re did not exceed 3%, at 10 exceed 15%, and when the samples (W/C composites) were heated in air, the release increased to 65% (typi- cal value for the majority of our experiments). This fact strongly suggests that, along with the emanation occurring at polymorphous transitions, there is some other process facilitating the release of radioactive microimpurities (in the form of volatile rhenium species ReO3, Re2O7) into the gas phase, e.g., their release in the course of cyclic gas transport reactions of the following type: oxidation of irradiated W metal with atmospheric oxygen (cid:7) sublimation of WO3 with the release of impurity 186Re atoms into the gas phase (cid:7) condensation of WO3 on graphite powder followed by its reduction to metal (cid:7) reoxidation of W metal, etc. We took this separation scheme as a basis for a (cid:3)dry(cid:4) process for 186Re production. Further experi- ments showed that the yield of the desired product can be increased to 85%, with its radiochemical purity being no worse than 99.99%. Radiation materials-science studies of cyclotron targets based on isotopically enriched powdered 186W. In view of the above facts, it seemed appropri- ate to take pressed 186W/C composites as cyclotron targets for preparing 186Re.

Context: reprocessing technology is based on the Purex extraction process, which uses tributyl phosphate (TBP) in a light diluent as an extractant. After the extraction of uranium and plutonium from the SNF solution, transplutonium elements (TPE)—long-lived isotopes 241,243Am (T1/2 = 433 and 7370 years, respectively) and relatively short- lived 244Cm (T1/2 = 18 years), as well as a group of fragmented raﬃ nate. At the same time, in several hundred years, the main contribution to the HLW radioactivity will be made by long-lived isotopes of americium. The modern strategy for the development of the nuclear power industry in Russia provides for the closed nuclear fuel cycle (CNFC), including minimizing the radioactive waste volume for deep disposal.

Context: The elemental composition of SNF from VVER- 1000 reactors with a burnup of 60 GW day/(t U) and holding for 8 years was calculated in [17]. It is shown that the fraction of fragmented lanthanides is 17.2 mg per 1 g of initial uranium. Provided that during the dissolution of SNF it is planned to increase the uranium concentration to 600 g/L, the actinide-lanthanide fraction will account for up to 10.5 g/L of fragmented lanthanides. In this work, we used Pr as a lanthanide simulant, whose absorption bands do not coincide with those of Am(III), Am(V), and Am(VI), which makes it possible to determine the concentrations in solution of both Pr and Am in various oxidation states by the spectrophotometric method. To prepare a model solution of the actinide– lanthanide fraction, the 241Am, 243Am, and 244Сm isotopes were used, the concentrations of which in the initial solution were 2.48 × 10–3, 1.28 × 10–1, and 1.38 × 10–4 g/L, respectively. The Pr concentration was 10.5 g/L. Americium was transferred to the highest oxidation states Am(VI) and then to Am(V) according to the following reactions (1) and (2), respectively:

Context:  Am(VI) in organic phase is reduced mainly to Am(V) and partially to Am(III), and after 1 day storage, Am(V) completely transforms into Am(III). However, in some works, contradictions were noted regarding the stability of Am(VI) in the presence of TBP. Thus, the authors of [14, 16] point to the relative stability of Am in the or- ganic phase, while it was stated in [21] that contact with organic phase led to a rapid americium reduction result- ing in a lower D(Am) than expected. Thus, from the data in Table 1, it can be concluded that Am(VI), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, is successfully extracted with 30% TBP in Isopar-M from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of NH4NO3 salting-out agent. Therefore, this approach to the separation of Am(VI) from Cm and lanthanides un- der these conditions is technologically unrealizable.

Context: The isotope 90Sr, formed during the ﬁ ssion of uranium and plutonium nuclei, together with 137Cs makes the main contribution to the global pollution of water and soil on Earth. Atmospheric nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility of 90Sr brings about its distribution in the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of living beings, where it concentrates in the bones and damages the surrounding tissues. The obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment is complicated by its nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the matrix material, exposure until equilibrium with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid– liquid extraction is widely used for the separation of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is eﬃ ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2]. But in both cases, a preliminary acid digesting of the samples is necessary, which involves the use of toxic and aggressive reagents. We proposed

Context:  Model experiments with natural samples were conducted as follows. A sample of building sand was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and dried in an oven. After that, a sample of sand weighing 1 g was taken. A solution of stable yttrium nitrate was added to the sample in such an amount that its concentration in the ﬁ nal sample was 30 mg/L, everything was thoroughly mixed and dried in an oven, after which 3 g of Na2CO3 and K2CO3 were added to the sample. The resulting mixture was calcined in a muﬄ e for 1 h at 500°C. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the sample was placed in a polypropylene test tube, 50 mL of the leaching agent solution was added to the sample (5 leaching agents were tested in total—H2O/H2O2 (3 : 2), NaHCO3/H2O2, NH4HCO3/H2O2, and (NH4)2CO3/H2O2, (NH4)2CO3). For 2 h, a sample of sand was contacted at stirring with the aqueous phase to transfer yttrium carbonate into the aqueous phase. Then the aqueous phase was separated and sent for extraction with a mixture of 0.01 M 2.3DHN + 0.015 M MTOAC in toluene at a volume ratio of the organic and aqueous phases O : A = 1 : 1 and a contact time of 10 min. Afterwards, the phases were separated by centrifugation. Yttrium was stripped from the organic phase with a 0.05 M HNO3 solution at O : A = 5 : 1, after which the nitric acid aqueous solution was separated by centrifugation. The content of stable yttrium was measured therein by the spectrophotometric method. A soil sample (500 g), taken in a forest belt on the territory of the Leningrad Region, was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and mixed with a radioactive label containing a 90Y/90Sr pair being in radioactive equilibrium with a total activity of 530 Bq (the speciﬁ c activity of the soil was about 1 Bq/g ). A soil sample labelled with 90Y/90Sr was dried in an oven, after which a sample (2 g) was taken.

The content of Ti varied from 1.5 to 30 g/L, the Sb content varied from (2–5)×10–3 g/L, a value corresponding to the addition of the 124Sb label, to 14.4 g/L, the H2O2 : Ti molar ratio was from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1. The label was obtained from an irradiated antimony target. The sorption and desorption of tin was performed under dynamic conditions by passing the solution through a column (d = 0.6 cm) with a sorbent layer 6 cm high. Two anion-exchange resins were used as sorbents: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Before ﬁ lling the column, the sorbents were kept in 6 M HCl for 12 h. First, 10 mL of the initial solution was passed through the ﬁ lled column at a rate of 0.8 mL/min and then 40–50 mL of a 6 M HCl washing solution passed. For desorption of radiotin, 1–4 M HNO3 solutions were used. Model solutions used for extraction have a total acidity of 6.6 M and a volume of 30 mL and contain 4.66 М HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, Ti (20 g/L), Sb in the form of antimony chloride with a concentration from (2– 5)×10–3 to 1 g/L, and 0.2–1 М KI. Also, (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn) produced from the irradiated antimony target was added to the model solution as label. To prepare a model solution, a weighed portion of KI was preliminarily dissolved in a minor amount of water and added, with vigorous stirring, to a mixture of HClO4 and H2SO4 acids. Iodine was formed, and the larger the weight of KI sample, the darker the solution. However, even at low KI concentrations, when the solution was light yellow, a precipitate formed, presumably HIO. The solution was left for a day to reach equilibrium. Then, it was ﬁ ltered, and the label and stable titanium and antimony were added, and after that, the extraction was performed. The prepared solution was stored for no more than a week. As the organic phase, we used benzene previously saturated with a solution of 4.66 М HClO4 +

Context: of positively charged complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+. These complexes are stable in acidic media, including HCl, in which tin forms the anionic complexes [SnCl6]2–. Our preliminary experiments showed that Ti macroquantities are not sorbed from 2 M HCl and are not completely sorbed from 1 M HCl. The ion-exchange separation of radiotin from titanium was carried out from 0.5 M HCl, while the titanium concentration was reduced by a factor of 20. However, this method is not entirely suitable for solving our problem, since large volumes of sorbent are required to remove macroamounts of titanium, which should be disposed and lead to the loss of radiotin. The separation of radiotin from titanium on strongly basic anion exchangers turned out to be more promising approach. The above possibility was studied on model solutions. The chromatographic procedure consisted of passing a hydrochloric acid solution of radiotin and titanium, containing a small stoichiometric excess of H2O2, through an anion exchange resin. In this case, [SnCl6]2– anions were sorbed on the column, while [TiO(H2O2)]2+ cations passed through the column. The column was washed with 6 M HCl to remove titanium. The titanium concentration in the washing solution and, as a consequence, in the target product depended on the degree of puriﬁ cation of the initial solution from macroamounts of antimony (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that an increase in the antimony concentration has adverse eﬀ ect on the puriﬁ cation from titanium. Next, we compared the eﬃ ciency of puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, tellurium, and antimony residues on two strongly basic anion exchangers: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Both resins, similar in composition but diﬀ ering in brands, have approximately the same eﬀ ect in relation to tin, tellurium, and antimony radionuclides. At the same time, they diﬀ er in relation to titanium (Fig. 2). Figure 2 shows that titanium is more easily washed out of a

Context: To conclude, the processes of separation of no-carrier- added 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound irradiated with protons have been investigated. The dissolution of TiSb in the HCl and HNO3 acids with the addition of HNO3 and H2O2 has been studied. It was shown that the presence of titanium in the resulting solutions does not impede the eﬀ ective extraction of most of the antimony with dibutyl ether. For further separation of radiotin from macroquantities of titanium, both chromatography and extraction can be used. Using the chromatography method, we studied the possibility of separating radiotin in the form of [SnCl6]2– from titanium in the form of an oppositely charged complex [TiO (H2O2)]2+ on strong AG 1 × 8 and

Context: Using the pilot vacuum chamber, we isolated the products of nuclear reactions from natural metal zinc irradiated with deuterons (13.6/6.0 MeV). Zinc was virtually quantitatively removed from the irradiated target: after treatment, no photopeaks at 0.4386 [69mZn, 68Zn(d, p)] and 1.116 MeV [65Zn, 64Zn(d, p)] were recorded. The yields of 66Ga [66Zn(d, 2n)], 67Ga [66Zn(d, n) and 67Zn(d, 2n)], and 64Cu [66Zn(d, (cid:4)) and 67Zn(d, (cid:4)n)] were about 98%, whereas the content of impurity zinc radionuclides was less than 0.02%. A significant difference in the vapor pressures of all the elements to be separated (Zn, Cu, Ga) in a wide temperature range (Fig. 2) should allow prepara- tion of 67Cu with a radionuclide purity of about 99%.

In the course of irradiation of the en- riched 124Te target with protons with the initial energy of 15(cid:0)18 MeV (e.g., close to the energies of the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerator), the following reactions can proceed: 124Te(p, n)124I, Ethr 3.98 MeV, T1/2 4.18 days; 124Te(p, 2n)123I, Ethr 11.63 MeV, T1/2 13.19 h; 124Te(p, d)123mTe, Ethr 7.24 MeV, T1/2 119.7 days; 124Te(p, 3He)122Sb, Ethr 9.90 MeV, T1/2 2.7 days; 124Te(p, (cid:4)n)120mSb, Ethr 5.33 MeV, T1/2 5.76 days. The highest yields of transmutation radionuclides will be observed for reactions (p, n) and (p, 2n), i.e., the main radionuclide impurity in the final product will be 123I. The energy dependences of the yields of 123I and 124I [7] are given below.

Context:  The optimal energy of protons and the yields of the final product and impurity 123I were evaluated using the reference data [7]. However, the data on the in- dustrial production of 124I at the Hammersmith Hos- pital (London, the United Kingdom) [3] showed that the absolute yields of 124I given in this handbook are underestimated by a factor of almost 3.5. For example, the yield of 124I at irradiation of the enriched tellurium target with 12.5-MeV protons is 2.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, and not 0.76 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, as given above. At the same time, the ratios of 124I and 123I are similar: only 2% of 123I is remains in the target after irradiation of the enriched tellurium (99.8%) target.

Context: (Rules and Regulations in Nuclear Power Engineer- ing, hereinafter PNAE) [16]. Criteria for selection of the support material. Comparative analysis of thermal and mechanical prop- erties of these metals (V, Nb, Ta) [6] and typical products of nuclear reactions showed that metallic tan- talum is the best support material for elemental tel- lurium. As compared to commonly used materials (Ag, Cu, Al, Pt), the loss in the thermal conductivity can be compensated by a decrease in the target thick- ness owing to higher strength properties of tantalum. The main aim of this part of the study was to deter- mine the process parameters of preparing 124I under the conditions of operation of the industrial target as- sembly of the COSTIS system (COmpact Solid Target Irradiation System) for the derived beam of the IBA Cyclone 18/9 accelerator. Main parameters of thermal processes in the course of irradiation of tellurium target on tan- talum support are given in Table 2. All further calculations were carried out taking into the data on the operation conditions and account geometric size of the target assembly of the COSTIS system (Fig. 3). In our calculations we used the following data: size of the support disc (24 mm in diameter, 2 mm thick), diameter of the effective irradiation area (12 mm), size of the inlet titanium foil (12 mm in diameter, 0.05 mm thick); temperature of the target assembly (15(cid:0)30(cid:8)C), helium flow rate (25 l min(cid:2)1), water flow rate (16 l min(cid:2)1), and water pressure (0.5 MPa). Since the tellurium target is cooled from the op- posite sides with water and helium, maximal tempera- tures are observed in the material bulk and not on the target surface. The coefficient of heat transfer at the tellurium(cid:0)helium boundary can be calculated only when the helium pressure is known (or set); it can be calculated taking into account the size of titanium window and the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 Calculations of the main characteristics of the helium heat exchanger. Helium heat exchanger is a diffuser(cid:0)confuser. Arrangement of the tellurium and titanium surfaces in the area of this unit strongly intensifies the heat exchange; the diffuser divergence (or confuser convergence) angles in the direction of titanium increase the coefficient of heat transfer at the helium(cid:0)titanium boundary, providing more efficient cooling. At a proton beam current of 15 (cid:5)A, the foil re- ceives 11.2 W and can be cooled by helium convec- tion (at a helium pressure PHe 30 mm Hg) if its mech- anical contact with the stainless-steel frame of the heat exchanger is efficient. With a decrease in the working pressure from 30 to 20 mm Hg, the temperature of the titanium foil de- creases from 136 to 112 (cid:8)C, and the conditional coef- ficient of the pressure reserve increases by a factor of almost 2. However, operation under such conditions is impossible because of the extremely high helium flow velocity (1306 m s(cid:2)1 at PHe < 25 mm Hg) exceeding the speed of sound ((cid:9)1060 m s(cid:2)1). Our calculations of the helium pressures in accor- dance with the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 [16] showed that the titanium foil can operate at a helium pressure of 30 mm Hg. The maximal working stresses are smaller than 100 MPa at a maximal tem- perature of the titanium window of 138(cid:8)C. With an in- crease in the helium pressure, the mechanical stresses linearly increase; the breaking stress decreases because of increasing temperature of the foil. Evaluation of the principal dimensions of the tantalum support and its strength; determination of the working temperatures of the support and tellurium target. The choice of the dimensions of the tantalum support reduces to evaluation of the thick- ness (STe) of the hollow bottom where tellurium is placed. In turn, STe determines some main character- istics of the target: voltage level, maximal flexure,

Context: divinylbenzene copolymer was used as a carrier. The TODGA content in the sorbent was 40 wt %, the granule size was 0.315–0.50 mm. For puriﬁ cation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column lled with AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent, the volume ﬁ of the sorbent in the column was 4 cm3. Before the experiments, the sorbent was treated in a column with a 5 M nitric acid solution for 2 h. At the sorption stage the initial solution was passed through the column at a rate of 6.0 column volumes per an hour [(c.v.)/h]. The ﬁ ltrate at the column outlet was collected and tested for the amounts of chemical impurities. After the end of the sorption, a 3 M HCl solution was passed through the column at a rate of 3.0 c.v./h to remove the initial solution residues. Desorption of 90Y was performed with 0.01 M HCl. The passing rate was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. The supply of the solutions during pre-treatment and at all stages was carried out using a peristaltic pump from bottom to top. The total time of sorption puriﬁ cation was 5–6 h. Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The 90Sr/90Y pair separation experiments were carried out employing a model solution containing 1.5 g/dm3 strontium and 0.15 mg/dm3 yttrium nitrates and 0.01– 0.3 M nitric acid therewith a label of the equilibrium 90Sr/90Y pair was introduced into the model solution in an amount of about 105 Bq/dm3. At the ﬁ rst stage of separation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 D5041 phosphate cation exchange resin (Purolite, Great Britain). Then the sorbent was washed with a 0.01–0.3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 3 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined. At the second stage of separation, hydrochloric acid desorbate was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent. Then the sorbent was washed with a 3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 0.01 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined for at least 35 days. The setup scheme is shown in Fig. 1.

Context: Nitric acid and ytterbium and lutetium oxides of chemically pure grade, 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) manufactured by Luoyang Zhongda Chemical Co. with a purity of at least 99%, bis-(2,4,4- trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) from Cytec Solvay Group (content of the main substance 90.6%), isopar-M (Exxon Mobil), and m-nitrobenzotriﬂ uoride (F3) with a chemical purity of 99% were employed in the study. The solution was evaporated to dryness. After cooling, the resulting mixed salt was dissolved in 1 M HNO3, transferred into a 25-mL volumetric ﬂ ask, and made up to the mark with distilled water. As a result, standard solutions of 20 g/L Lu and 200 g/L Yb were obtained. Working solutions were prepared by diluting the standard. Working concentrations varied from 0.05 to 200 g/L. The concentrations of standard solutions were monitored by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ISP-OES) on a Prodigy Plus spectrometer. The following characteristic wavelengths of radiation of Yb and Lu atoms were chosen: ytterbium,

Context:  phase and to Eq. (2), as well as indirectly conﬁ rms the participation of P507 dimer molecules in the formation of compounds with REE. It is known that the use of heavy ﬂ uorinated diluents, for example, F3, also leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients; therefore, it was of interest to study the eﬀ ect of this diluent on the REE extraction with P507 solutions. The nature of the relationship between the REE distribution coeﬃ cients and the HNO3 concentration in the extraction of Yb and Lu with P507 solutions in F3 does not depend on the nature of the diluent (Fig. 3), however, the inﬂ uence of the solvation mechanism starts to manifest itself somewhat earlier (from 3 M HNO3) than in the case of extraction with Р507 solutions in isopar M. The curve of the distribution coeﬃ cients of ytterbi- um and lutetium vs. the P507 concentration in isopar-M constructed in logarithmic coordinates (Fig. 4) have a linear form with a slope close to 2, and not to 3, which may be a consequence of an increase in the degree of association of extractant molecules with a growth in its concentration. This fact leads to a decrease in the REE extraction constants with a rise in the P507 concentra- tion (Table 1). The concentration equilibrium constants of Eq. (5) turned out to be the same for isopar M and F3, therewith for lutetium they turned out to be lower than for ytterbium.

Context:  It is known that the use of bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) as an extractant instead of P507 leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients by approximately 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining high values of the separation factors [20, 21]. Therefore, it was of interest to study the regularities of Yb and Lu extraction with solutions of Cyanex-272 in isopar M. In contrast to the system with P507, the functions of the logarithms of the Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration at a concentration of less than 1 M in this system have a slope of about –2.5 (Fig. 6), which results in the need to apply for simulation of the REE extraction in this region not only Eq. (2), but also Eq. (8) derived from Eq. (1) at m = 2 and n = 1:
