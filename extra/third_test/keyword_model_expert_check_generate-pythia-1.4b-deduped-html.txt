Context: Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.
