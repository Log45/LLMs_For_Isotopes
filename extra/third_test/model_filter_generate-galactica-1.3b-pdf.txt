Context: Abstract—Extraction systems based on extraction of tetrafl uoroboric acid (HBF4) with tributyl phosphate (TBP) and triamylphosphine oxide (TAPO) for boron isotope separation were studied. Tetrafl uoroboric acid was studied in comparison with boric acid (H3BO3). The extraction isotherms at 20°C for four systems (boric and tetrafl uoroboric acids extracted with TBP and TAPO in o-xylene) were obtained, and single-stage isotope separation factors for these four systems were determined. The lighter boron isotope (10B) is concentrated in the aqueous phase in the systems containing tetrafl uoroboric acid, whereas in the systems with boric acid it is concentrated in the organic phase.

Context: Vigorous progress of such fi elds as nuclear power engineering, medicine, and instrument making makes it necessary to develop and produce specialty materials enriched in certain isotopes of various chemical elements. In particular, the boron isotope 10В, which has high cross section of thermal neutron capture, is a valuable constituent of many materials. For example, materials based on 10B are demanded in nuclear power engineering, namely, in reactor control and protection systems and in production of steel for transportation racks and containers for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Boron-10 is used in neutron capture therapy for cancer treatment. High demand for materials enriched in 10B and insuffi cient scale of their production make it topical to search for, study, and develop more effi cient and environmentally safe procedures for boron isotope separation. Methods based on chemical isotope exchange, when isotope eff ects infl uence the properties of complexes of the extractive compound and extractant, are candidate separation methods. The “anisole process” is the most known and effi cient among such methods. It is based on the reaction of gaseous BF3 with anisole CH3ОC6H5 to form the complex CH3ОC6H5∙BF3(l). This complex

Context: isotope composition were prepared by dilution of the initial solutions of boron-containing components (boric and tetrafl uoroboric acids) to a boron concentration of 1–5 mg/L. In the case of tetrafl uoroboric acid, it was subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of CaCl2 to remove fl uoride ions interfering with the analysis. As organic diluent for the extractants we chose o-xylene, because this diluent prevents the third phase formation in extraction systems and favors fast phase separation, in contrast to aliphatic diluents such as dodecane. Prior to use, o-xylene was washed four times with equivalent amounts of distilled water. Chemically pure grade boric and tetrafl uoroboric acids were used without additional purifi cation. Tartaric acid was recrystallized from water and dried; the melting point after the purifi cation was 167°С. Tributyl phosphate was purifi ed as described in [7].

Context: We determined the distribution ratios for each extraction system. The highest distribution ratio D is reached in the HBF4–TAPO system: 1.5 at low acid concentrations. High distribution ratio D is an advantage in commercial separation of boron isotopes, because at one extraction step the larger fraction of the substance is extracted, and thus the amount of the enriched product obtained increases.

Context:  Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly infl uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetrafl uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances. Boric acid as a weak acid cannot be effi ciently extracted into the organic phase without additional complexation; therefore, tartaric acid is added to aqueous boric acid solutions. Tartaric acid converts boric acid into a complex that is a stronger acid interacting with the extractant more effi ciently. Tetrafl uoroboric acid does not require such additives. It is interesting to consider organophosphorus compounds as extractants. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is one of the most readily available and widely used commercial extractants. Along with TBP, mixed trialkylphosphine oxide Cyanex 923 is used for the recovery of metal ions. Despite their wide use for the extraction of metal cations, there are few data on extraction of boron-containing acids with them. Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) were studied as extractants for acids structurally similar to HBF4, i.e., for monobasic complex metal-containing acids HMHal4, where М is a metal and Hal is a halogen. The data presented in review [5] show that compounds of metals in oxidation state (III) (such as Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III)) are extracted in the organic phase to form ion pairs consisting of solvated proton and metal-containing anion. HBF4 can be assumed to be extracted by OPCs by a similar mechanism. Mishra et al. [6] report the results of the extraction of HFeCl4 with tributyl phosphate (D = 3–8) and mixed trialkylphosphine oxides Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 (D = 2–8). Khoroshilov and Ivanov [4] studied the boric acid– TBP extraction system in the context of separation of boron isotopes. They obtained the single-stage isotope separation factor α = 1.0067 ± 0.0035 at 20–22°С. In this system, 10В was concentrated in the organic phase.

Context:  Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly infl uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetrafl uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances.

Context:  The synthesis and study of the properties of superheavy elements (SHE) is one of the fundamental areas of modern nuclear physics. Research in this area is being actively carried out both in Russia and in nuclear centers of other countries (Germany, Japan, USA).

Context:  components can be enhanced. The chelating reagent α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (α-HIBA) and its salts (main- ly ammonium) are used in ion-exchange processes of intra- and intergroup separation of REE and TPE radio- nuclides of [5–17]. Cation exchange methods are used to separate REE and TPE radionuclides by elution with solutions containing α-HIBA and its salts. Strongly acidic styrene–divinylbenzene sulfonic cation exchange resins, such as Dowex 50W-X8, Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8, and a number of their other analogues, are utilized as sorbents [6, 10, 12–16]. As a rule, in the technique used [5, 6, 9–12], trivalent actinides are fi rst adsorbed from a dilute (<0.5 M) HNO3 solution on a cation exchange + form, resin. Then the sorbent is converted into the NH4 and the actinides are eluted with a chelating reagent (α-HIBA). It was noted in [8, 14] that, without prelimi- nary conversion of the cation exchange resin to the am- monium form by eluating with an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, the released H+ ions have a strong inhibi- tory eff ect on poorly sorbed elements, such as Cf. Anion exchange chromatography using a strongly basic anionite Bio-Rad AG X8 was chosen as a method for purifying Am, Cm from Pu impurities. According to the literature data, Pu(IV) sorption on strongly basic anion exchange resins is possible from nitric acid and hydrochloric acid media [18–20]. In nitric acid media, Pu(IV) can be sorbed starting from 1 M HNO3, 2– therewith the maximum concentration of the Pu(NO3)6 anion is reached at 7.7 M HNO3 [18]. Sorption of Pu on anion exchange resins is also possible from high concentration HCl solutions. The distribution coeffi cient of Pu(IV) increases monotonically with a rise in the HCl concentration and, starting from a 9 M concentration, exceeds 1 × 103 [19]. Under these conditions, Am(III) and Cm(III) are not retained by the sorbent. This work was aimed at developing regimes for the purifi cation of Cm and Am from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as developing the regimes for the separation of Am and Cm and their purifi cation from Cf and Eu by ion exchange chromatography.

Context:  The results in Tables 1–4 show that with an increase in the α-HIBA concentration at the second stage of the stepwise elution process, the width of the chromato- graphic peak at the base diminishes and the number of theoretical plates rises, i.e., peak blurring is reduced. At the same time, the selectivity α and the resolution RS de- crease, i.e., the overlapping degree of chromatographic peaks increases. It was noted in [25] that two substances will be separated if the selectivity α > 1; for a satisfac- tory separation, RS must be equal to 1. The separation is considered complete if RS is equal to or greater than 1.5. Therefore, the Cm and Am separation, as well as their purifi cation from Eu and Cf, is recommended to be carried out by stepwise elution with 0.1 M (pH 5.0) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the fi rst and second stage, respectively.

At low concentrations, the amount of sorbed substance is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase, and a linear sorption isotherm is observed (the distribu- tion coeffi cient does not depend on the concentration of the substance in the liquid phase). Each component of the zone moves at a constant rate, since the linear rate of its migration depends on the fl ow rate of the mobile phase, which is set constant. The entire zone moves with the same rate, remaining symmetrical: the concentration of the component is maximum in the center of the zone and decreases symmetrically towards the edges. There- fore, the peak on the chromatogram is also symmetrical (Figs. 1–3). If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeffi cient is greater than for low concentra- tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra- tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm). As a result, the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred and the peak is asymmetric. Since the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred when Am and Cf are removed from Am and Cf (Fig. 4), it can be assumed that the Cm sorption isotherm has a concave character. For a concave isotherm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diff use leading edge; the retained volume increases with increasing ion concentration. For the specifi ed Cm weight, the following charac- teristics were experimentally determined: the retention volume V = 35.4 c.v., the width of the chromatographic peak at the base W = 6.1 c.v., the dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeffi cient D = 35, the number of theoreti- cal plates N = 539. Comparison with the experimental results with indicator amounts of 244Cm (Table 2) shows that the number of theoretical plates N decreased when purifying the weight amounts of Cm. The result ob- tained agrees with the data of [9], in which the eluative separation of Am and Cm on a sulfonic cation exchange resin with α-HIBA was studied. It was shown in [9] that with an increase in the initial loading of the column with the mixture to be separated, the chromatographic sepa- ration effi ciency of Am and Cm decreases (the number N of theoretical plates decreases). Using the developed technology, for the fi rst time at RIAR, a 248Cm radionuclide material with a radionuclide and chemical purity signifi cantly exceeding the indicators of preparations obtained using standard technology was produced [1–3]. The characteristics of the 248Cm preparation are as follows: the content of fi ssion products (an activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeffi cient is greater than for low concentra- tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra- tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm). As a result, the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred and the peak is asymmetric. Since the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred when Am and Cf are removed from Am and Cf (Fig. 4), it can be assumed that the Cm sorption isotherm has a concave character. For a concave isotherm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diff use leading edge; the retained volume increases with increasing ion concentration. For the specifi ed Cm weight, the following charac- teristics were experimentally determined: the retention volume V = 35.4 c.v., the width of the chromatographic peak at the base W = 6.1 c.v., the dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeffi cient D = 35, the number of theoreti- cal plates N = 539. Comparison with the experimental results with indicator amounts of 244Cm (Table 2) shows that the number of theoretical plates N decreased when purifying the weight amounts of Cm. The result ob- tained agrees with the data of [9], in which the eluative separation of Am and Cm on a sulfonic cation exchange resin with α-HIBA was studied. It was shown in [9] that with an increase in the initial loading of the column with the mixture to be separated, the chromatographic sepa- ration effi ciency of Am and Cm decreases (the number N of theoretical plates decreases). Using the developed technology, for the fi rst time at RIAR, a 248Cm radionuclide material with a radionuclide and chemical purity signifi cantly exceeding the indicators of preparations obtained using standard technology was produced [1–3]. The characteristics of the 248Cm preparation are as follows: the content of fi ssion products (an activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

At low concentrations, the amount of sorbed substance is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase, and a linear sorption isotherm is observed (the distribu- tion coeffi cient does not depend on the concentration of the substance in the liquid phase). Each component of the zone moves at a constant rate, since the linear rate of its migration depends on the fl ow rate of the mobile phase, which is set constant. The entire zone moves with the same rate, remaining symmetrical: the concentration of the component is maximum in the center of the zone and decreases symmetrically towards the edges. There- fore, the peak on the chromatogram is also symmetrical (Figs. 1–3). If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeffi cient is greater than for low concentra- tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra- tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm).

Context: The regimes of Cm and Am purifi cation from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as the Am and Cm separation re- gimes and their purifi cation from Cf and Eu by ion ex- change chromatography were determined. It was estab- lished that the separation of Pu microamounts from Am and Cm can be carried out by its sorption on a strongly basic Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (50– 100 mesh) from 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2. The Am and Cm separation and their purifi cation from Cf and Eu by cation exchange chromatography with the α-HIBA ammonium salt solution as an eluent were tested. The REE and TPE separation is carried out in the regime of stepwise elution with the α-HIBA ammonium salt so- lutions of 0.1 (pH 5.0) (fi rst stage) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) (second stage) concentrations. At the fi rst stage of the process, Cf is recovered; at the second stage, Eu, Cm, and Am are separated. In experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am, the characteristics of the chromatographic process of cation exchange purifi cation were determined: the number of theoretical plates N, distribution coeffi cient D, selectivity (separation factor) α, resolution RS. It was noted that upon purifi cation of weight amounts of Cm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diff use leading edge, i.e., the concentration Cm corresponds to the nonlinear section of the sorption isotherm. With a nonlinear sorption isotherm, the blurring of chromatographic zones increases and the effi ciency of the chromatographic column diminishes (the number of theoretical plates N decreases and the resolution of the Am and Cm peaks decreases), resulting in reducing the separation completeness of these elements Purifi cation of weight quantities of 248Cm was carried out, and the 248Cm preparation was produced with the fol- lowing characteristics: the content of fi ssion products (the activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤ 2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

Context:  There are at least three criteria in choosing the ra- dioactive isotope for in vivo and in vitro tracer studies. The radiation should be easy detectable; the half-life of the radioisotope should be neither too short nor too long; and the cost of the radioisotope should be moder- ate [1]. Lead-203 has a very simple decay mode (Fig. 1). It decays by electron capture followed by emission of γ-rays with energies of 279 (81%), 401 (5%), and 680 keV (0.9%). 203Pb with a half-life of 52 h is poten- tially useful for clinical scanning. High specific activ- ity and radiochemical purity of 203Pb are important for radiolabeling. 1–5 mCi of 203Pb radioisotope contains a trace amount of lead, which is less than 0.1% of the normal daily lead intake [2]. There are a number of methods for the 203Pb production [2–5]. Lead-203 is produced from either mercury or thal- lium target. Natural mercury has six stable isotopes. Several radionuclides of lead and thallium can be pro- duced by bombardment of natural mercury with 3He or 4He particles. Separation of 203Pb using this method is very difficult. The use of enriched mercury as a target material could partially solve this problem, but the cost of the obtained 203Pb will be very high. Therefore, the preferred target material for the production of 203Pb is

Context: Materials and equipment. Thallium(I) sulfate (99.9%) was purchased from UCB (Union Chimique Belge). Lead nitrate was purchased from Fluka. Stan- dard 1000 mg L−1 solutions of lead and thallium were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. All the other chemi- cals were purchased from Merck. Cu backings were produced in our workshop. All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade and were used without fur- ther purification. Working solutions of Pb and Tl were prepared by diluting appropriate amounts of the stock solutions. A Hydro Ultrapure water purification system was used for making deionized water needed to prepare all the required solutions. An HPGe detector system (CanberraTM, GC1020-7500SL) in conjugation with a PC-based MCA and A Metrohm 827 pH meter was used. Target preparation. Natural thallium(I) sulfate (Tl2SO4), was chosen as the target material. High- quality thallium targets (70 μm) were prepared by elec- trodeposition of 1 g of Tl on 12 cm2 copper backings. The first plating bath is prepared by dissolving a por- tion of natTl2SO4 in an aqueous alkaline solution con- taining EDTA as a complexing agent, hydrazine hy- drate as an anodic depolarizer, and Brij-35 as a wetting agent. Constant-current electrolysis was carried out by applying a bipolar chopped saw-tooth voltage between the Pt anode and copper cathode. Target irradiation.

Context:  The total amount of 203Pb before and after separa- tion was determined in all cases by the region of inter- est (ROI) values. The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods. The irradiation yield is 2.2 mCi μA–1 h–1.

Context: Studies concerned with the possibility of targeted delivery of actinium examined the sorption of 225Ac on various supports in radiopharmpreparations. For example, it has been shown that it is possible to use liposomal carriers [11–14] or nanoparticles based on inorganic substances: LaPO4 [15–19], InPO4 [20], GdVO4 [21], and TiO2 [22]. At the same time, application of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) seems to be promising because of the important properties: potential biocompatibility of their separate forms, accessibility in industrial amounts, low cost as compared with vector molecules, and the possibility of varying their biodistribution upon an appropriate modifi cation. However, the evidence about using CNMs as actinium supports is extremely scarce [23, 24].

For this purpose, a solution of 228Ra in HNO3 was evaporated to dryness in a glass fl ask on an electric hot plate, dissolved in 4 M HNO3; and the solution was placed in a column with RE extraction-chromatographic sorbent (Triskem Int., France, based on carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide and tributyl phosphate) with volume of 2 mL. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by selective elution from the column: fi rst, 228Ra was eluted with a 4 M HNO3 solution, and then 228Ac, in 0.05 M HNO3, with fractions collected each having a volume of 1 mL The purity of 228Ac was determined by registering its gamma- spectrum during three days. To perform experiments on sorption of actinium on CNMs, the 228Ac eluate in 0.05 M HNO3 was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in several mL of a phosphate buff ered saline (PBS) with pH 7. Gamma-spectrometry. The content of thorium, radium, and actinium, in the samples was found by the gamma-spectrometry on a spectrometer equipped with a GR 3818 high-purity germanium detector (Canberra Industries, United States). Thorium was identifi ed by the gamma-peak of 228Th with energy of 84.4 keV. The content of 228Ra was determined by using the additionally introduced gamma-emitting 226Ra (186 keV, 3.6%) obtained via dissolution of 226RaBr2 in 0.01 M HCl. 228Ac was determined from the lines at 338 (11.3%) and 911 (25.8%) keV. Characterization of CNMs. We used in the study the following commercial samples of CNMs: powdered detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) of UDA-TAN brand (Federal State Unitary Enterprise SKTB Tekhnolog, Russia), aqueous suspension of partly reuced graphite oxide (GO), and powdered multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Nanotekhtsentr OOO, Tambov, Russia). The morphology of CNM particles was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on a JEM-2100F/Cs/GIF instrument (JEOL, Japan). The specifi c surface of the CNMs was determined by the method of thermal desorption of nitrogen in terms of the BET model. The content of impurity elements in the CNMs was found by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP- MS) (X Series 2, Thermo Scientifi c, United States). The elemental composition of the CNM surface was determined by the method of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical, Great Britain). The hydrodynamic diameter of CNM particles in hydrosols was determined by the method of dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Red Badge, 633 nm) ZEN 3600 analyzer (Malvern Instruments, United States). Acid functional groups on the CNM surface were determined by potentiometric titration. The surface of the CNM samples was modifi ed by the procedures described in [29, 30]. DNDs were oxidized in a 3 : 1 mixture H2SO4/HNO3 at 120°C for 24 h, and GO and MWCNTs were hydrogenated in the Ar + 10% H2 atmosphere at 800°C for 5 h. Study of the sorption behavior of 228Ac on CNM. In a study of the sorption of Ac(III) on CNMs, a 100-μL portion of a CNM suspension was placed in polypropylene test tubes with a cover, and 900 μL of the resulting solution of 228Ac was added. The test tubes were shaken on a TS-100 shaker (Biosan, Latvia), and after that the mixture was centrifuged on a CM-50 centrifuge (Eppendorf, United States) for 20 min at 18000 g. Then, the gamma-spectrum of the 228Ac solution was recorded, and the counting rate of an aliquot of the solution was compared with that for a reference sample. To determine the amount of desorption, to the solution and precipitate remaining in the test tube was added a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, with the content of BSA in the resulting solution being 40 g/L. The contents of the test tube were stirred up and placed on a shaker, after which the phases were separated by centrifuging for subsequent radiometric measurements.

The content of 228Ra was determined by using the additionally introduced gamma-emitting 226Ra (186 keV, 3.6%) obtained via dissolution of 226RaBr2 in 0.01 M HCl. 228Ac was determined from the lines at 338 (11.3%) and 911 (25.8%) keV. Characterization of CNMs. We used in the study the following commercial samples of CNMs: powdered detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) of UDA-TAN brand (Federal State Unitary Enterprise SKTB Tekhnolog, Russia), aqueous suspension of partly reuced graphite oxide (GO), and powdered multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Nanotekhtsentr OOO, Tambov, Russia). The morphology of CNM particles was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on a JEM-2100F/Cs/GIF instrument (JEOL, Japan). The specifi c surface of the CNMs was determined by the method of thermal desorption of nitrogen in terms of the BET model. The content of impurity elements in the CNMs was found by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP- MS) (X Series 2, Thermo Scientifi c, United States). The elemental composition of the CNM surface was determined by the method of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical, Great Britain). The hydrodynamic diameter of CNM particles in hydrosols was determined by the method of dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Red Badge, 633 nm) ZEN 3600 analyzer (Malvern Instruments, United States). Acid functional groups on the CNM surface were determined by potentiometric titration. The surface of the CNM samples was modifi ed by the procedures described in [29, 30]. DNDs were oxidized in a 3 : 1 mixture H2SO4/HNO3 at 120°C for 24 h, and GO and MWCNTs were hydrogenated in the Ar + 10% H2 atmosphere at 800°C for 5 h. Study of the sorption behavior of 228Ac on CNM. In a study of the sorption of Ac(III) on CNMs, a 100-μL portion of a CNM suspension was placed in polypropylene test tubes with a cover, and 900 μL of the resulting solution of 228Ac was added. The test tubes were shaken on a TS-100 shaker (Biosan, Latvia), and after that the mixture was centrifuged on a CM-50 centrifuge (Eppendorf, United States) for 20 min at 18000 g. Then, the gamma-spectrum of the 228Ac solution was recorded, and the counting rate of an aliquot of the solution was compared with that for a reference sample. To determine the amount of desorption, to the solution and precipitate remaining in the test tube was added a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, with the content of BSA in the resulting solution being 40 g/L. The contents of the test tube were stirred up and placed on a shaker, after which the phases were separated by centrifuging for subsequent radiometric measurements.

Context:  mixture was kept for one month till the complete decay of 224Ra. In the fi nal stage, 228Ac was separated from 228Ra, 208Pb, and newly formed 228Th. For this purpose, a solution of 228Ra in HNO3 was evaporated to dryness in a glass fl ask on an electric hot plate, dissolved in 4 M HNO3; and the solution was placed in a column with RE extraction-chromatographic sorbent (Triskem Int., France, based on carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide and tributyl phosphate) with volume of 2 mL. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by selective elution from the column: fi rst, 228Ra was eluted with a 4 M HNO3 solution, and then 228Ac, in 0.05 M HNO3, with fractions collected each having a volume of 1 mL The purity of 228Ac was determined by registering its gamma- spectrum during three days. To perform experiments on sorption of actinium on CNMs, the 228Ac eluate in 0.05 M HNO3 was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in several mL of a phosphate buff ered saline (PBS) with pH 7.

Kinetics of Ac(III) sorption on CNM in PBS at 25°C, m/V ratio 100 μg/mL. found here that the yield of 228Ac is nearly quantitative (not less than 95% relative to the amount placed on the column), with the separation factor of 228Ra and 228Ac being 2.2 × 104. According to [31], 208Pb is eluted from the column together with 228Ra. Thus, we developed a method for separation 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state from large amounts of natural thorium. The isolated 228Ac can be used in scientifi c studies, including in vivo experiments. It was found that, with the developed method implemented, the loss of 228Ra does not exceed 0.005% of the amount placed in the column. Therefore, the starting 228Ra preparation can be repeatedly used. For this purpose, the fractions from 1 to 9 mL were evaporated and again dissolved in 1 mL of 4 M HNO3. It was shown that the results are reproducible because 228Ac could be eluted from the generator we developed not less than 20 times. In a prolonged use of the solution of 228Ra, there occurs accumulation of 228Th occurs due to the decay of 228Ac, but 228Th is quantitatively sorbed on the column with RE in the process of separation of 228Ra and 228Ac [31]. It is supposed that the columns with the sorbent are intended for single use, and, therefore, 228Th does not contaminate the solution of 228Ac being prepared. In the many-years use of the generator, the extract of 232Th can be repeatedly used to extract 228Ra accumulated in it.

Context:  disappearance of its physical component, but positively aff ects the strength of binding between the conjugate and actinium in a solution of BSA in PBS. Interpretation of changes of this kind is diffi cult for GO and GO-H, and a further study of the 228Ac sorption mechanism on these samples is necessary. As for the interaction of 228Ac with CNTs, two mechanisms are probably operative in the sorption: sorption of ions within the tube hollows, as shown previously in [32], and the physical sorption on impurity metals (Table 1) contained at tube ends. In the hydrogenation, of CNTs, the catalyst is removed, which can account for the decrease in the total amount of sorption and the increase in the stability against desorption. To conclude, it can be noted that all the CNMs are promising for application in nuclear medicine as a carrier for actinium. In the case of limited amounts of radioactive isotopes of actinium, it is appropriate to use DNDs, GO, and CNTs for which the sorption is nearly quantitative, whereas DND-COOH, GO-H, and CNT-H are the most suitable for in vivo studies, For these the amount of desorption in 3 h does not exceed 5% in solutions of a model biological medium, whereas for the commercial CNMs under study it is about of 40%.

Context: Abstract—Atorvastatin was radioiodinated and formulated using chloramine-T via an electrophilic substitution reaction for the development of a potential radiopharmaceutical for targeting liver. The impact of diff erent reaction parameters and conditions that aff ected the labeling yield such as pH of the reaction, concentration of atorvastatin and reaction time were optimized in order to increase the radioiodination effi ciency. The labeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.41 %. In vitro analysis demonstrated that the compound was steady for up to 24 h. The liver uptake was 40.35% and the clearance pathways proceed via the hepatobiliary and renal clearance.

Context:  Atorvastatin is a representative of lipid-lowering drug family recognized as statins. It acts selectively in the liver as inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and cho- lesterol synthesis. It is chemically described as (3R,5R)- 7-[2-(4-fl uorophenyl)-3-phenyl-4-(phenylcarbamoyl)- 5-propan-2-ylpyrrol-1-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acid [1]. The lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the radiolabeled complexes determines the binding affi nity for hepatic transport proteins, the effi ciency of their hepatocyte up- take, and the excretion pathways [2, 3]. Atorvastatin is taken up selectively into the liver (hepatocytes) via organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) [4, 5], excreted into the biliary system, and stored by the gallbladder [6, 7]. Atorvastatin is a lipophilic statin but is relatively hydrophilic compared to simvastatin and lovastatin, which makes it more hepatoselective and able to cross cellular membrane either by passive diff usion and/or active carrier-mediated process [8, 9]. The liver-selective uptake and the tissue- specifi c distribution of atorvastatin via organic anion transporters ensure high pharmacological eff ect. In the liver, the statin drug undergoes Cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism [10–13]. The dominant active

Context: metabolites are 2-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid [14, 15]. Elimination of atorvastatin occurs from the systemic circulation through the liver via the bile into the feces and through the kidneys via the renal- urinary system [16–19]. Most of the hepatobiliary radiopharmaceuticals available for imaging are labeled with 99mTc. They exhibit identical pharmacokinetic properties in animals. They are effi ciently removed from the blood by the liver and excreted into the bile. Moreover, they diagnose diseases of hepatocytic function and the functional status of the cystic duct and the gallbladder [6]. The mechanism of in situ oxidative radioiodination using chloramine-T (CAT), involving the formation of iodine monochloride (ICl), was elucidated [20, 21]. In weakly acidic media, CAT dissociates to ArSO2NCl– anion, which may react directly with iodide to form ICl. Subsequently the iodine monochloride (ICl) reacts with any position in the target molecule that can experience electrophilic substitution [20, 22]. Owing to the diff erence in the electronegativity between iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and acts as a source of iodonium ion (I+). Therefore, aromatic electrophilic labeling with electropositive radioiodide usually proceeds in high radiochemical yield compared to 50% yield if molecular

Context:  iodine is used, because ICl is a stronger iodinating agent than I2 [23, 24]. The electrophilic iodination method is applied to various types of receptors and ligands as long as those ligands have a site where the substitution can occur and are stable under the oxidizing conditions at pH of the reaction. Synthetic routes to radioiodinated compounds are usually more diffi cult compared to other halogen- containing radiopharmaceuticals because iodine is the largest, the least electronegative, and the most polarizable of the halogens and forms the weakest C–X bond [25, 26]. Elemental iodine is weakly reactive, requiring an activator for effi cient introduction into organic compounds [27]. On the other hand, iodonium ion (I+), which acts as an electrophile for the radioiodination process, can be generated in situ in the presence of CAT as a convenient oxidizer, thus enabling the effi cient and selective direct iodination of atorvastatin under ambient conditions [28, 29].

Context: and HPLC. The infl uence of the CAT concentration (3–75 mM), atorvastatin amount (25–200 μg), pH of the reaction mixture (3–11), and the reaction time (5–60 min) on the radiochemical yield was examined. The conditions were optimized in order to enhance the labeling yield. Radiochemical analysis. The radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin was determined by silica gel thin-layer chromatography (SG-TLC). Samples were spotted 2 cm above the lower edge of the strip (1 cm width, 13 cm length). TLCs were developed in a benzene : ethyl acetate mixture (7 : 3 v/v). The radiochemical yield was expressed as the percent ratio of the radioactivity of 125I-atorvastatin to the total radioactivity. The radiochemical yield was the mean value of three experiments. Purifi cation and chromatographic analysis of the radioiodinated complex were performed on Agilent HPLC system coupled to a sodium iodide radiometric detector. A 10-μL aliquot of 125I-atorvastatin solution at the optimum conditions was injected into a reversed-phase C18 column (Waters, 150 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm) kept at 25°C and was eluted with a mobile phase that contained 0.05 M CH3COONa buff er and CH3CN (40 : 60, v/v) and was adjusted to pH 4.0. Atorvastatin was detected by UV absorbance at 246 nm. The mobile phase was fi ltered and degassed before use and was pumped at a fl ow rate of 1.00 mL/min [30]. In vitro stability. The in vitro stability of the complex was evaluated by incubating 1 mL of the reaction mixture at 37°C for 24 h. Exact 2–30 μL aliquots were extracted and analyzed at various time intervals using TLC and HPLC to determine the percent content of 125I-atorvastatin. Lipophilicity (partition coeffi cient log P). The lipophilicity of 125I-atorvastatin was measured experimentally by adding 5 mL of n-octanol and PBS (50 : 50) to a centrifuge tube containing a 1 mL aliquot of the radioiodinated compound. The tube was shaken for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The two phases were separated before aliquots (500 μL) of each phase were removed and counted in a well-type NaI(Tl) γ-counter. The partition coeffi cient (log P) is the ratio of the radioiodinated compound concentrations in the octanol phase and PBS at equilibrium. The extraction was performed in triplicate.

Context:  Synthesis of 125I-atorvastatin was carried out by direct electrophilic substitution with no-carrier-added 125I (T1/2 = 60 days) under oxidative conditions in the presence of CAT. The presumable reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The TLC results show that radioiodide stayed near the origin (Rf = 0–0.1), while 125I-atorvastatin proceeded with the solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1). The radiolabeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.4% (n = 5). It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the purifi cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin.

It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the purifi cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin.

An increase in the reaction time beyond 30 min led to a small decrease in the radiochemical yield due to side oxidative reactions, whereas shorter reaction time is apparently insuffi cient for CAT to fully react with iodide ions and generate the iodonium ions. water. The experimental log P of the labeled molecule (5.9 ± 0.3) was found to be higher than that of atorvastatin (5.4), which may be due to the attachment of iodine. Therefore, atorvastatin is eluted before radioiodinated atorvastatin on reversed-phase HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 1). The lipophilic characteristics of 125I-atorvastatin are important for predicting the uptake and excretion pathways, as hydrophobic radiopharmaceuticals are generally extracted via the hepatobiliary pathway (effi ciently taken up from the blood by the liver, excreted into the bile, and stored by the gallbladder) and slightly via the renal route as it was demonstrated from the in vivo biodistribution studies.

Further increase in the amount of atorvastatin beyond 50 μg had no eff ect on the labeling yield; i.e., the amount of 50 μg is suffi cient to capture all the produced iodonium ions.

The increase in the thyroid radioactivity from 1.73 ± 0.03% at 0.5 h and 6.1 ± 0.3% at 4 h p.i. suggests the presence of free radioiodide, presumably due to the metabolism of the compound. The stomach and thyroid uptake shows that only a limited amount of radioiodine was released from the 125I-atorvastatin in vivo, confi rming satisfactory in vivo stability and insignifi cant biological decomposition due to metabolism.

Predosing the mice with nonradioactive atorvastatin 0.5 h prior to the injection of labeled compound decreased the liver uptake to 19.25 ± 0.52% ID/organ.

The biodistribution studies carried out in mice expressed the affi nity of 125I-atorvastatin for hepatic cells. 125I-labeled atorvastatin behaves as a lipophilic compound, is extracted by liver on hepatocytes, and is excreted into the bile duct and fi nally into the intestine. The maximum liver uptake occurs approximately within 30 min after the injection. 125I-atorvastatin clears predominantly by the hepatobiliary pathway.

Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efficiently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context:  In order to make 64Cu via the nuclear reaction of 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu, we made the enriched 64Ni targets on a gold (Au) disk by electrodeposition of 64Ni from an aqueous solution of 2+ at pH = 9.05, using a robust, reliable and user-friendly apparatus (Figure 1). The Au Ni(NH3)6 disk (30.8 mm diameter × 1.5 mm thickness) was used as a cathode, and a platinum wire was used as an anode. A cavity of 12.1 mm diameter and 0.2 mm depth was milled into the Au disk and 64Ni (99.32%) was plated into this cavity. The 64Ni electroplating was performed with a constant current of 15–25 mA at 2.4–2.6 V in the aqueous solution for 48–72 h. During the electrodeposition, the green color of the 64Ni plating solution gradually faded away and the bubbling of H2 gas was clearly visible. When the 64Ni plating solution became colorless, the electrodeposition was finished. The absence of Ni2+ was also confirmed by analytical test strips. After cleaning and drying, the plated 64Ni on Au-disk was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, assuming a uniform thickness on the disk.

Context:  The quality of 64Cu produced was evaluated by analysis of its metallic impurities and measurement of half-life of its radioactivity. The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was used to evaluate the amount of metallic impurities in a decayed 64Cu solution, and showed a concentration of 6.339 ppb of Ni (0.127 μg), 4.112 ppb of Cu (0.082 μg), 5.502 ppb of Zn (0.110 μg), 0.108 ppb of Fe (0.002 μg), 0.102 ppb of Co (0.002 μg), 0.669 ppb of Ga (0.013 μg). The gamma spectrum of the produced 64CuCl2 solution (Figure 3) showed that the 64Cu radionuclide purity was >99%. The half-life of the produced radioactivity was determined by the radioactivity measured at different time points into the following equations: where A is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at time t, A0 is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at 0 h, and λ represents the constant.

The 64Ni solid target on an Au-disk has a uniform surface, with the thickness of 10.73 μm, and no metallic impurities. The total plated 64Ni was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2 (assuming a uniform thickness). After irradiation of the target and purification, the gamma spectrum of the produced 64Cu showed its radionuclide purity to be >99%, with both peaks at 511 keV and 1346 keV. In addition, the produced 64CuCl2 solution has high specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into the modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was further used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: In this study, we presented the improved method for the preparation of 64Cu, especially the improved efficiency of electroplating of 64Ni. The 64Ni solid target on an Au-disk has a uniform surface, with the thickness of 10.73 μm, and no metallic impurities. The total plated 64Ni was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2 (assuming a uniform thickness). After irradiation of the target and purification, the gamma spectrum of the produced 64Cu showed its radionuclide purity to be >99%, with both peaks at 511 keV and 1346 keV. In addition, the produced 64CuCl2 solution has high specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into the modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was further used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: Abstract—The results of destructive radiochemical and elemental analysis of samples of experimental mixed nitride uranium-plutonium (MNUP) fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor are presented. Data on the nuclide composition and weight content of U, Pu, Am, Cm, Nd were obtained, the specifi c activity of 14C, 3H, 106Ru, the weight content of Zr, Mo, Pd, Rh in solution and in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF were determined. The burn-up depth of MNUP fuel is calculated from the ratio of the number of fi ssion product atoms, burn-up monitor, to the number of heavy atoms. The total accumulation of 145Nd and 146Nd isotopes, as well as 148Nd, was used as burn-up monitor.

After cooling the MNUP SNF solution to room temperature, the refl ux condenser was replaced with a refrigerator, and part of the SNF solution was distilled off at a temperature of 110–120°C. The condensate was collected in a 50 mL volumetric fl ask. The tritium content was determined in view of a preset proportionality coeffi cient (Kpr), which takes into account the tritium fraction that passed from solution to condensate. At a volume of the MNUP SNF initial nitric acid solution of 250 mL and a condensate volume of 50 mL, Kpr = 0.24 ± 0.02 [4]. The activity of 3H in the condensate solution and 14C in alkaline solutions of Petri absorbers was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The part of the SNF solution remaining after distillation was fi ltered through a double cellulose “blue ribbon” fi lter 11.0 cm in diameter with a pore size of 1–3 μm to separate the undissolved residue. The fl ask with the initial solution remains was washed three times with 1 M HNO3 (25 mL). The washing solutions were used to rinse the fi lters and combined with the basic SNF solution remaining after distillation. The double cellulose fi lter with the undissolved residue of the SNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was separated. Each fi lter was dissolved, and the contents of U, Pu, Zr, Mo, Pd, and Rh were determined in the resulting solutions.

At a volume of the MNUP SNF initial nitric acid solution of 250 mL and a condensate volume of 50 mL, Kpr = 0.24 ± 0.02 [4]. The activity of 3H in the condensate solution and 14C in alkaline solutions of Petri absorbers was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The part of the SNF solution remaining after distillation was fi ltered through a double cellulose “blue ribbon” fi lter 11.0 cm in diameter with a pore size of 1–3 μm to separate the undissolved residue. The fl ask with the initial solution remains was washed three times with 1 M HNO3 (25 mL). The washing solutions were used to rinse the fi lters and combined with the basic SNF solution remaining after distillation. The double cellulose fi lter with the undissolved residue of the SNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was separated. Each fi lter was dissolved, and the contents of U, Pu, Zr, Mo, Pd, and Rh were determined in the resulting solutions.

Context: Uranium was determined by the spectrophotometric measurement of the light absorption of the uranium com- plex with arsenazo III; plutonium, by α-spectrometry; and fi ssion products, by the atomic emission spectral method. The testing procedure is described in detail in [2]. At the fi nal stage, 8 M HNO3 solution (200 mL) was added to a fl ask with an undissolved fuel cladding, and control dissolution was carried out at a temperature of 95–100°C for 5 h. Upon dissolution process completion the α- and γ-spectrometric analyzes of the solutions were performed after the main and control dissolutions. The analytical line energies of radionuclides, their yields, as well as the half-lives for calculating the specifi c activities of radionuclides when calculating their volumetric activity in term of concentration, were taken from [7, 8]. The isolation and purifi cation of elements was car- ried out using a combination of cation-, anion-exchange, and extraction chromatograpy. The techniques devel- oped at RIAR were taken as the basis for the separation of SNF components. The isotopic composition of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, and Cm was determined in the isolated fractions. The analysis procedure is described in detail in [2–6, 9–11]. Quantitative determination of the U, Pu, Nd content was carried out by repeating the procedure for their isolation in the presence of a complex label by isotope dilution with mass spectrometric ending.

Context: The control dissolution of the fuel cladding was carried out upon completion of the dissolution process and separation of the undissolved residue. According to the data of α- and γ-spectrometric measurements of solutions, the content of α-emitters in the control solution is (3 ± 0.3) × 10–3% of their amount in the initial solution, content of γ-emitters is 0.1 ± 0.01%. The results of determining the burn-up depth, 3H, 14C, 106Ru specifi c activities in MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor, in comparison with the results, which we obtained earlier for MNUP fuel irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor, are presented in Table 3. The discrepancy between the results of determining the tritium specifi c activity is due to diff erent types of reactor plants and fuel composition irradiation modes, as well as the degree of 3H diff usion through the fuel cladding. Studies [13, 14] state that one of the main factors determining the tritium specifi c activity in SNF is the fuel temperature at the irradiation time. As the temperature rises, the tritium content in the fuel composition diminishes. It was shown in [14–16] that tritium formed during SNF irradiation diff uses through the fuel element cladding by 95–99%. Our data on the tritium specifi c activity in the fuel cladding agree with the results of [17], where the tritium specifi c activity in the fuel cladding with uranium oxide fuel and burn-up of 6.6–7.1% was 1.2 × 105 Bq/g. At the same time, it was found in [18] that the tritium content in the fuel element cladding of the VVER-440 reactor has a signifi cant spread and is in the range from 3.9 × 106 to 3.4 × 107 Bq/g. The authors note that the uneven distribution of tritium is observed both along the height and along the circumference of the fuel-element cladding. They conclude that the main part of the tritium enters the cladding through areas of a damaged protective zirconium oxide fi lm. From data presented in Table 3, it can be seen that the burn-up values of the MNUP SNF samples and the 14C specifi c activity in them change symbatically. With increasing in the burn-up of the analyzed SNF sample by 23%, the 14C specifi c activity increased by 25%. In the course of SNF dissolution, ruthenium is distributed over all elements of the dissolution apparatus: it partially remains in the SNF solution, condenses on the inner walls of the dephlegmator and connecting hoses, water cooler, enters the solution of the fi rst Petri absorber containing the HNO3 solution, passes into the condensate solution produced at the tritium specifi c activity determination stage, remains in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF.

Context: The control dissolution of the fuel cladding was carried out upon completion of the dissolution process and separation of the undissolved residue. According to the data of α- and γ-spectrometric measurements of solutions, the content of α-emitters in the control solution is (3 ± 0.3) × 10–3% of their amount in the initial solution, content of γ-emitters is 0.1 ± 0.01%. The results of determining the burn-up depth, 3H, 14C, 106Ru specifi c activities in MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor, in comparison with the results, which we obtained earlier for MNUP fuel irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor, are presented in Table 3. The discrepancy between the results of determining the tritium specifi c activity is due to diff erent types of reactor plants and fuel composition irradiation modes, as well as the degree of 3H diff usion through the fuel cladding. Studies [13, 14] state that one of the main factors determining the tritium specifi c activity in SNF is the fuel temperature at the irradiation time. As the temperature rises, the tritium content in the fuel composition diminishes. It was shown in [14–16] that tritium formed during SNF irradiation diff uses through the fuel element cladding by 95–99%. Our data on the tritium specifi c activity in the fuel cladding agree with the results of [17], where the tritium specifi c activity in the fuel cladding with uranium oxide fuel and burn-up of 6.6–7.1% was 1.2 × 105 Bq/g. At the same time, it was found in [18] that the tritium content in the fuel element cladding of the VVER-440 reactor has a signifi cant spread and is in the range from 3.9 × 106 to 3.4 × 107 Bq/g. The authors note that the uneven distribution of tritium is observed both along the height and along the circumference of the fuel-element cladding. They conclude that the main part of the tritium enters the cladding through areas of a damaged protective zirconium oxide fi lm. From data presented in Table 3, it can be seen that the burn-up values of the MNUP SNF samples and the 14C specifi c activity in them change symbatically. With increasing in the burn-up of the analyzed SNF sample by 23%, the 14C specifi c activity increased by 25%. In the course of SNF dissolution, ruthenium is distributed over all elements of the dissolution apparatus: it partially remains in the SNF solution, condenses on the inner walls of the dephlegmator and connecting hoses, water cooler, enters the solution of the fi rst Petri absorber containing the HNO3 solution, passes into the condensate solution produced at the tritium specifi c activity determination stage, remains in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF.

We failed to determine the 129I content in a dilute solution against the background of other SNF components. For detecting iodine, it is necessary to develop special procedures for its isolation from a SNF sample. The results of determining the isotopic composition and weight content of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, Cm in the MNUP SNF are given in Table 4. In parentheses are the values of the total absolute error in units of the last digits of the result for a confi dence level of 0.95. When fi ltering the MNUP SNF solution through a double cellulose fi lter, a light gray coating was observed on the upper fi lter. The sediment weight could not be fi xed, since the initial weight of the cellulose fi lter turned out to be greater than the weight of the fi lter with sediment. This experimental fact is probably associated with the destruction of cellulose under the action of α- and γ-emitting nuclides. According to the data of [19–21], the sediment weight upon uranium oxide SNF dissolution in nitric acid is no more than 0.6% of the dissolved fuel weight. It was found in [22] that, upon dissolution of irradiated mixed-oxide fuel with a burn- up of 31.7 to 54.7 GW/t in 3 HNO3 at 95°С, the the undissolved sediment weight does not exceed 1.3% of the SNF weight. When studying the dissolution of model nitride SNF [23], the volumes of 7.8 and 9.44 M HNO3 required for dissolution were calculated based on the nal concentration of metals in the solution: 280 and fi 400 g/L, respectively. It is shown that the weight of the undissolved residue is 1.8 and 2.26%, respectively. The results of detecting the content of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the solution and the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 5. The presence of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr was registered only on the upper cellulose fi lter; there were no these elements on the lower fi lter. The content of these elements in the solution obtained after the dissolution of the upper fi lter was equivalent to their content in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF. The total weight of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 was 0.0019 g, which is 0.07% of the dissolved SNF weight. The results of determining the uranium and plutonium content in the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 6. The data in Table 6 indicate that the U and Pu contents in the upper and lower fi lters are comparable. The close values of these quantities evidence that most of the U and Pu we found in solutions after the dissolution of the lters were sorbed by cellulose. fi The excess of the U content in the upper fi lter compared to the lower fi lter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds. The weight of undissolved U estimated from the diff erence between the U weight on the upper and lower fi lters, is 2.5 mg, or 0.09% of the total uranium content in the analyzed SNF sample.

The content of these elements in the solution obtained after the dissolution of the upper fi lter was equivalent to their content in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF. The total weight of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 was 0.0019 g, which is 0.07% of the dissolved SNF weight. The results of determining the uranium and plutonium content in the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 6. The data in Table 6 indicate that the U and Pu contents in the upper and lower fi lters are comparable. The close values of these quantities evidence that most of the U and Pu we found in solutions after the dissolution of the lters were sorbed by cellulose. fi The excess of the U content in the upper fi lter compared to the lower fi lter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds. The weight of undissolved U estimated from the diff erence between the U weight on the upper and lower fi lters, is 2.5 mg, or 0.09% of the total uranium content in the analyzed SNF sample.

Context:  be 8.2 × 103 Bq, and the 129I specifi c activity will be 41 Bq/mL. For radiochemical studies of SNF samples, a hundredfold dilution of the initial solution is utilizsed. We failed to determine the 129I content in a dilute solution against the background of other SNF components. For detecting iodine, it is necessary to develop special procedures for its isolation from a SNF sample. The results of determining the isotopic composition and weight content of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, Cm in the MNUP SNF are given in Table 4. In parentheses are the values of the total absolute error in units of the last digits of the result for a confi dence level of 0.95. When fi ltering the MNUP SNF solution through a double cellulose fi lter, a light gray coating was observed on the upper fi lter. The sediment weight could not be fi xed, since the initial weight of the cellulose fi lter turned out to be greater than the weight of the fi lter with sediment. This experimental fact is probably associated with the destruction of cellulose under the action of α- and γ-emitting nuclides. According to the data of [19–21], the sediment weight upon uranium oxide SNF dissolution in nitric acid is no more than 0.6% of the dissolved fuel weight. It was found in [22] that, upon dissolution of irradiated mixed-oxide fuel with a burn- up of 31.7 to 54.7 GW/t in 3 HNO3 at 95°С, the the undissolved sediment weight does not exceed 1.3% of the SNF weight. When studying the dissolution of model nitride SNF [23], the volumes of 7.8 and 9.44 M HNO3 required for dissolution were calculated based on the nal concentration of metals in the solution: 280 and fi 400 g/L, respectively. It is shown that the weight of the undissolved residue is 1.8 and 2.26%, respectively. The results of detecting the content of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the solution and the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 5. The presence of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr was registered only on the upper cellulose fi lter; there were no these elements on the lower fi lter.

Abstract: The emerging success of [68Ga/177Lu]Ga/Lu-DOTATATE as a theranostic pair has spurred interest in other isotopes as potential theranostic combinations. Here, we review cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m as a potential theranostic pair. Radionuclidically pure cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m have been produced on small cyclotrons with high molar activity. In vitro, DOTATOC labeled with cobalt has shown greater affinity for SSTR2 than DOTATOC labeled with gallium and yttrium. Similarly, [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE has shown improved cell-killing capabilities as compared to DOTATATE labeled with either indium-111 or lutetium-177. Finally, PET imaging with an isotope such as cobalt- 55 allows for image acquisition at much later timepoints than gallium, allowing for an increased degree of biological clearance of non-bound radiotracer. We discuss the accelerator targetry and radiochemistry used to produce cobalt-55,58m, emphasizing the implications of these techniques to downstream radiotracers being developed for imaging and therapy.

Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradi- ation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately.

Context: Cobalt-55 production was reported in 1938 from alpha irradiation of manganese [18] and has since been reported from many target materials and incident beams. Practically, two reactions are best suited for producing activities of cobalt-55 with few impurities: 58Ni(p,α)55Co and 54Fe(d,n)55Co, which are accessible on low energy cyclotrons [19]. These reactions have been thoroughly and recently reviewed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and significant independent efforts resulting in recommended excitation functions for the reactions discussed below [20]. The 58Ni(p,α)55Co reaction has been employed by many groups [14,21–24]. Sev- eral radioisotopic and radionuclidic impurities can be formed in this process. Cobalt-57 (t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 1377 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is produced from 58Ni(p,2p)57Co above 15 MeV [23], and production of cobalt-56 occurs above 25 MeV [25]. Nickel-57 (t1/2 = 35.68 h, β+ = 44%, Eγ= 1377.6 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is primarily produced via the 58Ni(p,2p)57Cu, which decays to nickel-57 with a half-life of 196 ms [21]. This reaction occurs above the threshold of 12 MeV, and is useful for monitoring separation efficiency during process development. However, nickel-57 decays to cobalt-57, which cannot be separated from cobalt-55. Natural nickel targets can also be used, but result in increased impurities that limit downstream clinical work [26]. Cobalt-55 can also be produced by the 54Fe(d,n)55Co reaction [27]. Theoretically, this method affords radioisotopically pure cobalt-55 compared with the proton-induced route described above, avoiding cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Practically, purities are limited by the achievable enrichment of the iron-56 target. The excitation function peaks near 7 MeV (Figure 1) [28]. Finally, manganese-52m is also coproduced via the 54Fe(d,α)52mMn reaction, which has a threshold energy of 4 MeV [28].

Previously reported excitation functions for (a) 58Fe(p,2n)57Co and (b) 58Fe(p,3n)56Co, measured using isotopically enriched targets [32]. Irradiating isotopically enriched iron-58 avoids the production of other impurities that cannot be separated out in the downstream chemistry. Natural iron is composed of iron-54 (5.8%), iron-56 (91.7%), iron-57 (2.2%), and iron-58 (0.3%). Proton bombardment of iron-54 leads to the production of very short-lived contaminants such as 54Fe(p,n)54Co (t1/2 = 1.46 m) and 54Fe(p,2n)53Co (t1/2 = 0.24 s) that do not diminish the radioisotopic purity of cobalt-58m. However, higher-energy proton reactions on iron-56 and iron-57, as described above for iron-58, may form longer-lived radioisotopic impurities cobalt-56 and cobalt-57.

Context: Nickel targets can also be irradiated with protons to produce cobalt-58m via the 61Ni(p,α)58mCo nuclear reaction (see Figure 8). Natural nickel has 5 stable isotopes: nickel- 58 (68.1%), nickel-60(26.2%), nickel-61 (3.6%), and nickel-64 (0.93%). Figure 8. Excitations functions for the production of cobalt-58 on nickel-61 targets [37,66–70]. Data reported by Uddin et al., Michel et al., Amjed et al., and Hermanne et al. are from the irradiation of natural nickel normalized to the abundance of nickel-61, where data beyond the threshold energy for 61Ni(p,nα), 10.3 MeV, were not considered. Just as with iron targets, isotopically enriched nickel targets are required to reduce the production of radioisotopic impurities. Using enriched material prevents the production of long-lived cobalt isotopes via the (p,α) reactions on nickel-58 (68.1%), nickel-60 (26.2%), and nickel-64 (0.93%), shown in Figures 9–11 below.

Context:  Though the proton- and deuteron-induced reactions are most accessible to the majority of modern cyclotrons, there are alternative routes utilizing helium-4 ions, neutrons, or helium-3 nucleus with comparable cross sections [75–77]. Alpha beams afford a particularly attractive reaction route using monoisotopic manganese targets via 55Mn(α,n)58mCo. The measured excitation functions are shown below in Figure 12a. If higher-energy alpha beams are used, cobalt-57 can be formed from 55Mn(α,2n), as shown in Figure 12b. To decrease the likelihood of producing this contaminant, lower- energy beams should be employed to capture the greatest cross section for the 55Mn(α,n)58Co reaction while minimizing the 55Mn(α,2n)57Co reaction.

In addition to charged particle-induced reactions, several alternative and less prag- matic routes to cobalt-58m can be contemplated, e.g., quasi-monoenergetic neutron or triton irradiations. Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons can be produced via 2H(d,n)3He re- action on hydrogen-2 gas targets. The neutrons bombard nickel or cobalt induce the 58Ni(n,p)58mCo and 59Co(n,2n)58mCo reactions [29,75]. Tritons can be generated via the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction within a nuclear reactor with an energy of 2.736 MeV. These ions go on to bombard [56Fe]Fe2O3 targets to produce cobalt-58m,g via the 56Fe(t,n)58mCo reaction route [76,85]. These alternative reactions currently rely on rare accelerator infrastructure or on significantly increased scale in terms of beam intensities. Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations.

Context:  Using the table above, it can be suggested that for the production of cobalt-55, iron-54 targets should be utilized based on the lack of potential long-lived radio-contaminants co-produced, and an increased yield at lower thickness targets when compared to yields produced by nickel-58. To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelera- tor capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

Context:  4. Radiochemical Isolation and Preparation 4.1. Anion-Exchange Chromatography Because both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m require isolation from iron or nickel target materials, many of the radiochemical isolation processes reported can be applied to multiple production schemes. Several anion-exchange resins such as Dowex-2, Amberlite IRA-400, and ANEX-L have been historically used for the separation of Co from various transition metals in HCl, HNO3, and HBr solutions [94]. Previously reported separation methods to remove nickel from cobalt used the AG 1 × 8 anion-exchange resin [14,24]. These methods included the use of multiple grams of resin packed into a glass column and equilibrated with 9 M HCl. The dissolved target solution in 9M HCl was loaded onto the column where the nickel elutes from the column in the eluate and 9M HCl wash in 10–40 mL. The cobalt-5x, which remains on the column during the large 9M HCl wash, is eluted from the column in 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl. The eluted cobalt fraction can then be evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in various matrices for further analysis and/or radiolabeling experiments. Anion-exchange chromatography also isolates cobalt-5x from iron target material [94]. After dissolving the target in acid, the iron is oxidized into the 3+ state with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of loading the cobalt-5x on to the anion-exchange resin and washing away the target material, as was performed in the nickel/cobalt anion-exchange separation, cobalt and iron are retained on the column when loaded. The cobalt can then be eluted form the anion-exchange column in 4 M HCl. The iron target will remain on the column during the 4 M HCl wash, but can be recovered in low concentrations of HCl. The HCl eluant containing cobalt-5x can also be evaporated and the cobalt-5x reconstituted in alternative matrices without incurring significant losses [26,28,86,87]. Separation of cobalt-5x from manganese is similar to the isolation of cobalt-5x from nickel targets, but can use even less concentrated acidic media. As summarized by Bate and Leddicotte in “The Radiochemistry of Cobalt”, manganese in a dissolved target solution passes through a AG1 × 8 anion-exchange resin in HCl concentrations > 4.5 HCl. Once the target material is removed, the column can be washed with <4.5 M HCl to elute cobalt-5x [94].

Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu- labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124]. Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.

Context: The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is a cell surface protein involved in cell growth, replication, angiogenesis and differentiation. It is overexpressed by many breast cancers, and expression status is used to determine eligibility for some therapies [127]. Detection of HER2 receptor status can be assessed with imaging, and [89Zr]Zr-trastuzumab has been evaluated in several clinical trials. However, when using a fully intact antibody such as trastuzumab, blood clearance is delayed and imaging is typically performed 4–5 days after injection of the radiotracer [128]. Additionally, use of full-sized antibodies for imaging results in high liver uptake as the antibodies clear through the hepatobiliary pathway. This property may result in obscurement of liver metastases. Use of a truncated antibody, such as a minibody, diabody, or fragment antibody for imaging allows for more rapid clearance, typically via the kidneys [129]. Using these constructs allows for imaging on the same day or next day, which means that a radionuclide with a shorter half-life than zirconium-89 may be preferred. With that in mind, an affibody for HER2 (DOTA-Z2395-C) was developed and 57Co- labeled (as a substitute for cobalt-55) [130]. In vitro studies with the 57Co-labeled HER2 affibody revealed that radiolabeling conditions only slightly reduced immunoreactivity of the affibody. In vitro, approximately 20% of the tracer internalized over 24 h in SKOV- 3 ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, biodistribution was similar to what was observed with [111In]In-DOTA-Z2395-C [131]. Blood clearance was rapid, falling from 0.5 to 0.027 % ID/g between 1 and 24 h PI. SPECT imaging of [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C at 4 h PI in mice bearing LS174T tumors (low HER2) and SKOV-3 tumors (high HER-2) revealed blockable tumor uptake and kidney clearance [130]. Like HER2, HER3 is overexpressed by certain cancer types. Additionally, HER3 ex- pression changes in response to therapy, increasing in tissues as they become resistant to HER2 targeted therapies [132]. As immunotherapies to HER3 are developed, it becomes important to develop tools to detect HER3 status in tumors [133]. Hence, an affibody which targets HER3 (HEHEHE-ZHER3) was conjugated with NOTA and radiolabeled with 57Co [134]. In vitro, incubation of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 with cells expressing low HER3 (DU145) and high HER3 (LS174T) showed better total binding to LS174T (~15% vs. 4% for DU145). Internalization was observed to be higher with the DU145 cells, with approxi- mately 50% of activity internalized by DU145 at 24 h, and less than 10% internalization seen with LS174T. As expected, the high expression line LS174T showed greater tumor binding in vivo, which was effectively blocked with non-labeled ZHER3. Uptake was also seen in tissues which have endogenous expression of HER3, namely the liver and intestines. Clearance occurred primarily through the kidneys. By 24 h PI, imaging showed that much of the activity in the liver and intestines had cleared [134].

The anti-HER2 [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C and anti HER3 [57Co]Co-ZHER3 affibodies showed promising tumor uptake, rapid blood clearance, and good imaging properties in the models tested. They would very likely translate well for labeling with 55Co for PET imaging. As a potential therapeutic, a 58mCo-labeled HER2/HER3 affibody may not show significant internalization needed for effective therapeutic response.

Context: A summary of molar activities obtained for the targeting paradigms discussed above is included in Table 3 below. Cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are ideally suited as a matched-pair theranostic for use in both research and clinical environments. A wide range of production pathways are available for cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m with distinct advantages to each method. For use in clinical applications, enriched targets coupled with modern cyclotrons are likely the best path forward since this method can result in high radiochemical purities (>98%). Furthermore, the literature for chelating cobalt-58m was reviewed and results compared with clinically approved and other contemporary radiopharmaceuticals. In many of the applications reported, cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are at least comparable to gallium-68 and lutetium-177 with some studies also reporting superior contrast with cobalt- 55 over gallium-68 and higher cell-killing efficiencies with cobalt-58m as compared to lutetium-177. However, despite the favorable results, there have not been any in vivo human trials using cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m in targeted radionuclide therapy and thus further studies are necessary.

Context: Abstract—The possibility of producing 225Ac and 223Ra by irradiation of natural 232Th with medium-energy protons was examined. Thorium foils were irradiated with 90-, 110-, and 135-MeV protons at the accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Troitsk (Moscow oblast). The cumulative production cross sections for 225Ac were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, and for 227Th (223Ra precursor), 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. Based on the experimental data and theoretical calculations, the possible yields of 225Ac and 223Ra in irradiation of thick thorium targets at various accelerators were deter- mined. An efficient procedure was suggested for isolating the products from the irradiated targets: 225Ac, by liquid extraction and extraction chromatography, and 223Ra, by sublimation from a thorium–lanthanum melt followed by thermochromatographic separation in metallic titanium columns and extraction-chromatographic isolation of radium. The procedure allows production of large (units of curies) amounts of radiochemically pure 225Ac and 223Ra, which is promising for wide use of these radionuclides in nuclear medicine.

Context:  Actinium-225 (T1/2 = 10.0 days) is one of the most promising α-emitting radionuclides for therapy of vari- ous tumor diseases [1, 2]. It is also promising to use this radionuclide in generators as a source of the daughter short-lived 213Bi (T1/2 = 46 min). Various methods for 225Ac production are known [3]. Usually this radionuclide is isolated from products of 233U decay following the scheme 233U (T1/2 = 1.6 × 105 years) → 229Th (T1/2 = 7340 years) → 225Ra (T1/2 = 14.8 days) → 225Ac [4, 5]. Difficult availability of the starting 233U restricts the possibility of producing large amounts of 225Ac. 229Th, from which 225Ac is di- rectly isolated, can also be produced from 230Th (T1/2 = 75 400 years) by irradiation with fast neutrons or γ-quanta [6]. The starting 230Th is a member of the 238U radioactive series, and its content is about 20 g per ton of uranium, i.e., this material is also difficultly avail- able.

Context: targets by their irradiation with fast or thermal neu- trons [7, 8], γ-quanta [9], or accelerated protons or other charged particles [10, 11]. The starting 226Ra is also difficultly available. In addition, radium targets of relatively large mass are dangerous in handling, which gives rise to serious problems in their wide application, especially in cases when radium regeneration from the irradiated targets is required. Another radionuclide promising for medicine is 223Ra (T1/2 = 11.4 days). It is directly used for therapy of bone tumor diseases [12]. It can also serve as a source of 211Pb (T1/2 = 36 min) in generators [13]. The common route to small amounts of 223Ra is its isolation from 235U decay products. Large amounts of 223Ra can be produced by irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reac- tor, followed by chemical isolation of the formed 227Ac (T1/2 = 21.8 years) decaying into 227Th (T1/2 = 18.7 days) and then into 223Ra. As already noted, irra- diation and processing of a radium target involve seri- ous problems.

Context: Fig. 1. Scheme of 225Ac isolation from irradiated thorium target. We believe that the most promising route of pro- duction of 225Ac, 223Ra, and some other important ra- dionuclides is irradiation of natural 232Th targets with medium-energy protons, followed by product isolation. In the early 1960s, Lefort et al. experimentally meas- ured the production cross sections of 225Ac and 223Ra from 232Th at a proton energy of 150 MeV [14], and Gauvin measured the 225Ac production cross sections at proton energies in the range 43–115 MeV [15]. Also, 232Th was irradiated with the aim of 225Ac pro- duction with 660-MeV protons at an accelerator in Dubna [16] and with 600-MeV protons at an accelera- tor in CERN [17]. The possibility of producing 225Ac from thorium by its irradiation with protons of the en- ergy lower than 40 MeV was noted recently [18], but no experimental data confirming this assumption were presented. On the whole, only limited information is available on optimization of production of various ra- dionuclides from a thorium target and on radiochemi- cal procedures for isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from irradiated Th and on their purification to remove other radionuclides. Up to now, 225Ac and 223Ra were not actually produced by this procedure. The major goal of this study was measuring the 225Ac and 223Ra production cross sections in reactions of Th with 90–135-MeV protons with the aim to opti- mize the conditions for production of large amounts of these radionuclides on the proton beam of the Moscow Meson Factory [Institute for Nuclear Research (INR), Russian Academy of Sciences, Troitsk]. In the course of our study, we developed efficient radiochemical procedures for isolating Ac and Ra in the radiochemi- cally pure state. It can be expected that wide use of 225Ac and 223Ra in medicine will allow in the future cardinal solution of the problem of treating many tu- mor diseases. Th irradiation. In irradiation experiments we used 10 × 10 mm2 pieces of 5-μm-thick Th metal foil. The foils were irradiated with a beam of accelerated pro- tons of energy 128, 143, and 158 MeV at the linear accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Rus- sian Academy of Sciences [19], at a beam current of approximately 5 μA. In the course of irradiation, tho- rium foils wrapped in aluminum foil were intensely cooled with a water flow. To decrease the proton en- ergy to 90, 110, and 135 MeV, graphite absorbers were arranged before the target. The accuracy in the proton energy determination was approximately ±2.5 MeV. The uncertainty was determined by the accelerator pa- rameters and by proton scattering as a result of their absorption by graphite and cooling water. The proton flux was monitored with Al and Cu foils by production of 22Na and 62Zn, respectively, whose production cross sections are known [20]. The foils after irradiation were withdrawn and sub- jected to γ-ray spectrometric analysis using a spec- trometer equipped with a HPGe detector with a beryl- lium window (Canberra GR 3818). 225Ac isolation.

Context:  tography. Irradiated Th metal foils were dissolved in concentrated HNO3, the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 3–8 M HNO3, and Th was extracted with two portions of 1–5 M TBP or 0.1–0.5 M TOPO solution in toluene [21]. After the Th extraction, the aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, concentrated HClO4 was added, and the solu- tion was evaporated to dryness to remove Ru isotopes. For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatogra- phy in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-di- (TRU- isobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) [11, 22]. After washing the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, Ac was eluted with the next 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, and the solu- tion was collected. For complete purification of Ac, the extraction chromatography was performed twice. The radiochemical purity of 225Ac was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry with a semiconductor PIPS detector (Canberra). 223Ra isolation. Chemical isolation of Ra from irra- diated metallic Th was performed by a gas-chemical method. For this purpose, a piece of irradiated thorium foil (3 mg) together with metallic La (280 mg) was placed in a crucible of metallic Zr. Addition of La (Тm = 918°С) leads to formation of a melt with Th (for Th, Тm = 1755°С), and in the liquid metal diffusion and, correspondingly, release of the sublimed micro- elements are considerably faster than in solid Th. The crucible was heated for 1 h in succession at 970, 1040, 1130, 1190, 1270°С in a stream of helium purified with a titanium getter (the heating temperature was determined with an accuracy of ±15°С). Radium and other radionuclides were deposited at the furnace out- let on tantalum collectors in the form of foils which were replaced when changing the heating temperature. In another experiment (Fig. 2), an irradiated tho- rium sample with metallic La was heated for 1 h at 1200 ± 15°С, and the released products were trans- ferred with a helium stream into a thermochroma- tographic column (quartz tube lined with titanium foil from the inside); the sublimed elements were deposited on the Ti surface in different temperature zones. After the heating completion, the titanium foil serving as collector for sublimed products was cut into pieces (corresponding to temperature zones), and the γ-ray spectrum of each piece of the collector was measured. After that, the piece of the collector with the deposited Ra, Ba, and Sr was subjected to further purification by

Thus, the experimentally measured production cross sections are cumulative, and they cannot be accurate, because the production cross sections of the parent 225Th, 225Ra, 229Pa, and 225Ra were not determined sufficiently reliably. Never- theless, these cumulative cross sections allow estima- tion of 225Ac yields in irradiation of targets in different ranges of proton energy. The 225Ac production cross sections that we calcu- lated from γ-ray spectrometric data are plotted in Fig. 4 in comparison with the theoretical values obtained us- ing different models: ALICE (ALICE-IPPE version) and cascade evaporation (СЕF). For the proton ener- gies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, the experimental cross sections were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, respectively.

The γ-ray spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of more than 80 radio- active isotopes of various elements in products of Th irradiation. Along with the desired 225Ac and 223Ra, other radionuclides are formed by fusion and spallation reactions and by the subsequent decay of the products of these reactions: 224Ra (Т1/2 = 3.7 days), 225Ra (14.8 days), 226Ac (29 h), 227Ac (21.8 years), 227Th (18.7 days), 228Th (1.9 years), 231Th (25.5 h), 228Pa (22 h), 229Pa (1.4 days), 230Pa (17.4 days), 232Pa (1.3 days), 233Pa (27 days), and 230U (20.8 days).

Extraction-chromatographic separation of Ac from other elements using a sorbent based on isobutylcarbamoyl phosphine oxide: (1) 224Ac, (2) 105Ru, (3) 131I, (4) 136Cs, (5) 140Ba/La, and (6) 141Ce. sired radionuclides: 111Ag (7.5 days), 103Ru (39.3 days), 106Ru (372 days), 131I (8.0 days), 126Sb (12.4 days), 127Sb (3.9 days), 125Sn (9.6 days), 123Sn (129 days), 124Sb (60.3 days), 127Xe (36.4 days), 115mCd (44.6 days), 129mTe (33.6 days), 136Cs 13.2 days), 95Zr (64.0 days), 95Nb (35.0 days), 93Y (10 h), 140Ba (12.8 days), 99Mo (66 h), 141Ce (32.5 days), 148mPm (41.3 days), 147Nd (11.0 days), etc. (several hundreds of peaks in the γ-ray spectra). The relative activity of 225Ac in the mixture formed was as low as ~1%, and that of 223Ra, several percents. Thus, isolation of radiochemically pure 225Ac from a complex mixture of radionuclides is a complex prob- lem. The process for 225Ac isolation from solution con- sisted of extraction and extraction-chromatographic steps. In liquid extraction, macroamounts of Th, and also Pa, Zr (>90%), I (>75%), and Nb (35–40%) pass to the organic phase, whereas the other elements, in- cluding Ac and Ra, remain in the aqueous phase. The results of extraction-chromatographic separa- tion of a number of elements in the carrier-free state are shown in Fig. 8. Washing of the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3 eliminates such interfering radionuclides as 136Cs, 105Ru, 140Ba, and 131I. The Ac fraction was eluted in the next 15 ml of the acid, whereas such in- terfering radionuclides as 141Ce and 140La remained on the column. We found that 225Ac was fully purified when the extraction chromatography was performed twice. Figure 3b shows the γ-ray spectrum of the iso- lated Ac fraction. The purity of the product obtained by irradiation of Th with 110-MeV protons and puri- fied using the above-described chemical procedure is characterized by the following parameters: chemical yield of 225Ac no less than 90%; radionuclidic purity of

Chemical isolation of Ra. Radium-223 was iso- lated by a gas-chemical method used previously for isolating certain actinide, lanthanide, and alkaline- earth elements in the carrier-free form [23, 24]. The method is based on the fact that Ra in the metallic state is considerably more volatile than Th and a number of other interfering elements (Ac, Pa, La, Pm, Ce, Nd, Be, Cr, Zr, Mo, Nb, Tc, Sn, Ag, Ru, Rh). The addition of metallic La is extremely important. Thorium placed in a zirconium crucible together with metallic La dis- solved in liquid La in the course of heating, which en- sured fast diffusion of the microelements being iso- lated in the liquid metal and high degree of sublima- tion of Ra isotopes. The presence of metallic La also stabilizes the metallic state of nonvolatile elements (actinides, lanthanides, and also Sn) which could sub- lime at the experiment temperature in the form of vola- tile lower oxides from vessels made of Ti and Zr [25]. Lanthanum also binds into nonvolatile compounds Sb and Te, which under other conditions readily sublime at approximately 1200°С [26]. Special experiments showed that without metallic La the Ra sublimation yield decreased and some other interfering elements sublime, which makes the subsequent thermochroma- tographic separation less efficient. Heating of the irradiated metallic Th in the pres- ence of La for 2 h at 1200°С ensured release of more than 99% of radium isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, 225Ra), of Sr and Ba isotopes, and also of I, Br, Cd, and Cs, which are highly volatile in the elementary state. The ele- ments that exhibit low volatility in the elementary state (Ac, Th, Pa, U, Ru, Sn, Zr, Nb, Y, Mo, Ce, Pm, Nd), and also Sb and Te did not sublime and fully remained in the crucible. Figure 9 shows the temperature de- pendence of the release of various elements from a melt with La (the points characterize stepwise heating of the same sample at successively increasing tempera- tures, for 1 h at each temperature). The relatively low degree of the release of I can be accounted for by low rate of diffusion of large iodide ion in a Th–La melt.

The subsequent extraction-chromatographic purifi- cation of this fraction allows us to obtain a fraction of pure Ra containing 223Ra with impurities of 225Ra and 224Ra (Fig. 3c).

Context:  Cadmium-109 is used for fabricating reference ion- izing radiation sources. It can be produced by neutron irradiation of silver. In irradiation of the starting material with >98% enrichment for 6 months in the SM reactor with ther- mal neutrons at a flux density of 1 × 1015 n cm–2 s–1, the total yield of all the Cd isotopes is about 50% rela- tive to the initial silver weight; the specific activity of 109Cd is 4–4.2 Ci g–1. The production of the desired radionuclide is accompanied by the production of a significant amount of 110mAg. The subsequent radio- chemical processing of the irradiated sample is per- formed to remove 110mAg from 109Cd, obtain the re- quired chemical form of the product, and regenerate expensive 107Ag for the repeated irradiation. The 110mAg/109Cd activity ratio in the final product should not exceed 3 × 10–4%. Extensive experimental data are available on the separation of Ag and Cd by ion exchange, extraction, and selective precipitation of Ag [1, 2]. The over- whelming majority of methods are methods of analyti- cal chemistry, unsuitable for operation with gram amounts of Ag and Cd in hot cells under the conditions of remote control. Only the precipitation methods based on precipitation of poorly soluble silver halides or of Ag metal after the silver reduction are an excep- tion. We believe that the precipitation of Ag metal, which is a compact readily settling powder that can be readily washed, is the easiest in implementation. This method was used for isolation and purification of 109Cd [3]; silver was precipitated from 0.1–2 M HNO3 in the presence of NaNO3 on SKN carbon sorbent. At equal initial activity of 109Cd and 110mAg, the Cd/Ag separa- tion factor was approximately 500–800. Final purifica- tion of Cd to remove Ag was performed by isotope dilution of Ag, followed by the AgCl precipitation. In contrast to [3], in numerous procedures for re- covering Ag from wastes the reduction, as a rule, is performed in weakly alkaline or ammonia solutions, because specifically in these media it is most complete [4]. This study was aimed at developing a procedure for Cd purification to remove Ag in one process cycle by reduction and precipitation of Ag from ammonia solutions, followed by the Cd concentration in the form convenient for the subsequent preparation of the 109Cd product (hydrochloric acid solution with preset HCl concentration). We chose as reductant hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS), which does not react with Cd. The precipitated Ag metal is the ready starting product for fabricating targets. Then, Cd is precipitated from the mother liquor in the form of basic cadmium carbonate, which is then readily dissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this study, we determined the conditions for the most complete reduction of Ag and precipitation of basic cadmium carbonate from ammonia solutions.

Context: As seen from Eq. (1), the Ag and HAS ions react in the 2 : 1 molar ratio. For the successful removal of Ag from Cd, it is important to know at what excess of HAS the residual concentration of Ag in the mother liquor will be the lowest. Figure 1 shows the results of experiments on the influence of the HAS/Ag molar ratio on the degree of reduction (precipitation) of Ag in an ammonia buffer solution at рН 10. As seen from Fig. 1, at HAS/Ag = 0.5, i.e., at a stoichiometric amount of HAS, 0.014% of Ag remains in the mother liquor, which corresponds to a decrease in the Ag concentration by a factor of 7.1 × 103. At HAS/Ag ≥ 1, the Ag concentration decreases by a factor of 1 × 105. Influence of рН on the Completeness of the Ag Reduction Because the Ag reduction is performed in an am- monia solution, Ag and Cd occur in the form of am- mine complexes. Therefore, it is hardly probable that an increase in the ammonia concentration and hence in pH will influence the completeness of the Ag reduc- tion. On the other hand, determination of the lower pH limit is very important for performing the process effi- ciently. HAS contains 1 mol of sulfuric acid per mole of the salt. According to Eq. (1), the Ag reduction is accom- panied by the formation of 2 mol of hydrogen ions from 1 mol of HAS. Apparently, the buffer capacity of the initial ammonia solution should exceed the sum of the concentrations of hydrogen ions released in the reaction of silver with HAS and introduced with HAS.

Apparently, the buffer capacity of the initial ammonia solution should exceed the sum of the concentrations of hydrogen ions released in the reaction of silver with HAS and introduced with HAS.

Logarithm of the mother liquor activity as a function of pH of the Ag reduction (precipitation) at HAS/Ag = 2. precipitate and solution depends on the concentration ratio of metal, ammonium, and carbonate ions and molecular ammonia as a complexing agent. For the efficient separation of Ag and Cd, it is necessary to find conditions at which Cd would completely occur in the carbonate precipitate and Ag would occur in the solution the ammine complex. Apparently, the minimal concentration of ammonia should be sufficient for dissolving Ag and Cd nitrates with the formation of the corresponding soluble ammine complexes of Ag and Cd. The maximal concentration of ammonia should be so as to allow no less than 95% precipitation of cadmium carbonate.

Context: Figure 3 shows the dependence of the degree of the CdCO3 precipitation on the NH4OH concentration at different NH4NO3 concentrations. The concentrations of potassium and cadmium carbonates in all the ex- periments were constant and equal to 0.3 and 0.1 M, respectively. As can be seen, at an NH4NO3 concentra- tion of 0–0.6 M the ammonia concentration should not exceed 0.8 M to ensure no less than 95% precipitation of Cd.

According to SRIM code (The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter);25 the thickness has to be 352 μm for 90° geometry. To minimize the thickness of the silver layer, a 6° geometry is preferred, in which case a 35 μm layer is recommended. Silver targets are prepared by DC-CCE (constant current electrolysis) of the metal from alkaline plating solutions.

Context:  Four symmetrical windows (22.36 or 11.69 cm2) on the vertical side wall allow up to four copper targets backing positioning. Each slot is sealed by an O-ring fitted window. The geometrical shape of the slot determines the actual target electrodeposition area. The liquid-tight sealing of the windows is realized by stainless steel mechanical pestles mounted on a PVC ring surrounding plating vessel and by pressing the copper backing against O-ring seal. An external PVC ring is fitted with four supporting pins to hold a motor-stirrer combination in position. The stirrer is a hollow perforated POM cylinder mounted on the axis of a DC motor and surrounding the platinum anode. The stirrer rotation speed is set at 600 rpm; during the process, its rotating direction is reversed after 8 seconds improving deposit homogeneity. To keep the desired temperature at a preset level, a heater (a series of six isolated 1 Ω/W resistors, through which an appropriate DC-current is forced (1.1 A, 40 °C up to 1.8 A, 60 °C) is circularly mounted at the bottom of the vessel. An insulated sensor, introduced through the stirrer support-plate, temperature. As monitors electrolysis to depletion requires long-time (up to 24 hours) plating, evaporation of plating solution occurs. To maintain a constant liquid volume (450 ml), a conductivity glass/graphite sensor monitors the solution level and actuates a peristaltic pump at the required rate, supplying distilled water to compensate evaporation losses. The rack-mounted home-made electronics includes a motor/stirrer control, an adjustable DC voltage generator card and four V/I converters coupled to current boosters.

Context: The freshly prepared solution of silver was poured into the plating vessel. This refined procedure is a result of several repeated experiments with different acidity and compositions of bath, different temperature and electroplating currents. The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined in by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (using a Joel Model JSM 6400 at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV). The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C (the temperature that the Ag layer can experience during a high current irradiation) for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water.

Context:  Since large amount of free cyanide in the bath forms a sedimentary layer on the Ag electrodeposition and consequently reduces the current efficiency, adjusting the quantity of free cyanide in the bath is important.26 On the other hand, less amount of free cyanide reduces the bath conductivity. Hence, the bath compounds should be optimized. According to some publications on concentrations of silver in the bath,21–26 a bath with 10.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 7 g.l–1 KCN and 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 was prepared. The data provided in Table 1 denote a poor current efficiency at high current density but also formation of chalk-white sediment on the Ag deposit. low Because in temperature, high current density and high free hydroxide,27 while application of a very low current density results in a rather poor quality of the deposit, and a very high current density reduces the over voltage of hydrogen and decreases the quality and the current efficiency.28 Hence, an optimal value was expected and investigated.

Context:  The current efficiency was determined at different current densities using DC current at room temperature (Table 1). An optimum DC current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 should be applied. Consequently, further experiments were carried out while using current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2, and changes were applied to the concentrations of bath compounds which consist of 8.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 8.5 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3. After changing the concentrations of the bath, the influence of acidity on current efficiency was concerned in further the experiments. These alternations had stopped undesired production of chalk-white sediment on the surface.

Context:  Adjusting the bath acidity is important for the effect of bath efficiency and coating physical properties. A large reduction on acidity causes hydrogen reduction and simultaneously sediment of the basis salts on cathode. After preparing the silver bath (while the pH of bath was about 11) for studying the effects of solution the acidity was acidity on electroplating quality, changed from 8.5 to 13. It is clear that the higher current efficiency and the better electrodeposited layers are available in lower acidity than it is in comparison to electrodeposited layers by higher acidity bath (Table 2).

Context: Silver is a relatively noble metal; most metals being less noble than silver form immersion deposits on the surface. This tends to happen even when the base metal enters the silver solution hot or live, that is, with a voltage already applied. The inevitable result of this phenomenon is poor adhesion of subsequent deposits. To minimize this effect, it is essential to employ a silver strike coating prior to the main deposit.21,24 In this work experiments were carried out on adhesion with and without strike coating. It was concluded that if the plating were carried out very rapidly, a good adhesion would be obtained in all electroplated targets without the need for strike coating. Embrittlement of metals has been recognized for many years but, as two authors have pointed out, some other defects in electrodeposits, such as blistering, cracking, gas pits, peeling off and poor adhesion, may also be related to hydrogen in ways not yet identified.26 Plating on a dietary or greasy surface inevitably leads to blistering or peeling of deposit. Cathodic cleaning in either acid or alkaline solutions provides large quantities of hydrogen for absorption.26 In all experiments, the substrate surface was cleaned with sandpaper of 1000 grade and immersed in the nitric acid bath of 0.3M. Then the surface was washed by water and its oil contaminators were removed by a mixture of the alkali cleaning powders. Finally, the surface was washed with acetone.

Context:  After finding the most economic and qualitative bath concentrations, some experiments were carried out for 2 to 10 hours for the solution that contained 5.16 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.16 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 at 24 °C. When the best quality and current efficiency was obtained in these experiments at room temperature and without adding any additives, a suitable molarity of the bath composition produced the current efficiency of 100% (Table 5). To estimate the quality of the electroplated silver targets some criteria had to be taken into account, such as homogeneity, morphology, visual appearance of the silver layer and thermal shock test. The homogeneity of the silver layer is important as it may seriously affect the production rate of 109Ca. This was determined by measuring the thickness of several parts of the layer by a micrometer and calculation of the standard deviation of the data.

Context: The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The evaluation of quality of the layers was achieved by comparison of the photomicrographs in terms of size and form of the Ag nuclei and the extent to which they overlapped each other. The smaller, more spherical and the more overlapping nuclei were considered to be a good plating quality. The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water. Observation of neither crack formation nor peeling off of the silver layers indicated a good adhesion for the purpose. SEM photomicrograph showed that the granulometry of electroplated targets with current density of 8.54–12.82 mA.cm–2 were not as desired (Figs 1a and 1b). Hence, current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 was chosen and the SEM photomicrograph showed a suitable granulometry (Figs 2 and 3). The SEM photomicrograph of the best electrodeposition of these baths is shown in Fig. 3.

Context:  Abstract—Zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrices were prepared by mixing solutions of zirconium oxychlo- ride, selenous acid, and sodium molybdate in different manners. The elution of the generated 99mTc radioactiv- ity from the obtained zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrices was studied using small chromatographic col- umns of the matrix. 6 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix dried at 50°C, packed in a glass column (1.1 cm i.d.), was eluted by passing 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 and ambient temperature (~25°C). The 99mTc elution yield of 77.1% was obtained. Radionuclidic, radiochemical, and chemical purity of the eluate proved to be suitable for use in medical applications.

Context: main disadvantages of fission 99Mo radioisotope gen- erators [13]. Alternative technologies are required to overcome these drawbacks. These alternative technolo- gies are based on incorporating neutron activation 99Mo of low and medium specific activity (0.3– 3.5 Ci g–1 Mo) into insoluble precipitates of high Mo content such as Ce, Zr, Mg, Ti, Fe, Th, Sn, and Te compounds, which are then used as column matrices [14–28]. Post- and pre-irradiation-formed gels are the two common techniques used for preparing gel genera- tors. Isotope exchange allows overcoming the radiation degradation resulting from irradiation of the prepared gel material and the multistep procedure in pre- and post-irradiation-formed gel techniques, respectively [16, 29]. Solvent extraction of 99mTcO4 – or sublimation of 99mTc2O7 has also been used in some generator sys- tems for extraction of 99mTc from 99Mo of relatively low specific activity, produced by direct neutron acti- vation of molybdenum targets [12]. This study was aimed at preparing 99Mo/99mTc gen- erator based on zirconium selenomolybdate as a col- umn matrix by post-irradiation-formed gel technique.

Context:  Radiometric identification and measurements were made with a multichannel analyzer (MCA) of Inspec- tor 2000 model, Canberra series (the United States), coupled with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) coaxial detector of GX2518 model. A UV-160 A UV-VIS spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was used for deter- mining Zr and Mo. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with an 18 kV diffractometer (D8 Ad- vance, Bruker, the United States) with monochromated CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Elemental analysis was carried out with a BW-1200 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Philips, Netherlands). The morphology was examined with a JSM-6510A field emission scan- ning electron microscope (FESEM) (Japan). The IR spectrum was recorded with an MB157S FT-IR spec- trometer (Bomem, Canada) in the range from 4000 to 400 cm–1 at room temperature. Thermal analysis, in- cluding simultaneous thermal gravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal (DTA) analysis, was carried out with a DTG-60H device (Shimadzu, Japan). Radioactive 99Mo solution. 99Mo was obtained by eluting a 99Mo/99mTc generator with alumina-packed columns (Mon-Tek Generator, Monrol Nuclear Prod- ucts Industry and Trade, Turkey), loaded with 20 GBq on calibration date. Each column was eluted with a 2 M NH3 solution. The 99Mo eluate was passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter to retain any possi- ble alumina particles. The ammonium molybdate-99Mo solution was gently heated to dryness and then redis- solved in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Alternatively, for pre- paring 99Mo/99mTc generators, solutions of fission 99Mo (~100 mCi) in 0.1 M NaOH solution were obtained from the ETRR-II Radioisotope Production Facility (RPF). Then, 99Mo solution was diluted with 1.0 M HCl to the desired pH value. Preparation of zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrix. 0.25 M Mo(VI) solution was prepared by dis- solving 3.025 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O in a small portion of distilled water with the addition of 5 mL of a 99Mo solution along with a few drops of 30% H2O2. The re- sulting sodium molybdate solution was warmed to de- stroy excess H2O2 and then cooled to room tempera- ture before adjusting to pH about 4.5 with 2 M HNO3. The volume of the Mo(VI) solution was completed to 50 mL with distilled H2O. 0.25 M Zr(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 5.062 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O in a small portion of distilled water and then was com- pleted to 62.5 mL, after which it was heated to 60°C and then left to cool to room temperature (~25°C).

For dry elution studies, a stream of air was passed through the molybdate bed to keep it free from the in- terstitial saline solution for the next elution. Preparation of 99mTc generator based on zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel matrix. A glass col- umn (1.1 cm i.d.) was packed with 6 g of the zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel. The generator was conditioned for elution of 99mTc by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution through the column bed and then left overnight to be ready for the elution of the gener- ated 99mTc radionuclide. The 99Mo content in the eluate (99Mo breakthrough) was determined, in the case of its presence, as the con- tribution of the count rate of 181 or 739 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum to the total count rate. The γ-ray spectrum of the eluate was measured directly after elu- tion and after 3 days. The radionuclidic purity of the eluted 99mTc was determined as the contribution of the count rate of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum. The radiochemical purity defined as the percentage of 99mTc radioactivity present in the 99mTcO4 – form was determined by ascending paper chromatography using Whatman no. 1 chromatographic paper and 85% methanol as a developing solvent. The activity distri- bution along the chromatogram was determined with a γ-ray spectrometer, and Rf was calculated as the ratio of the distance (cm) traveled by 99mTc species from the starting line to the peak position to the distance (cm) traveled by the solvent from the starting line to the sol- vent front. The possible Zr, Mo, and Se impurities in 99mTc eluate were determined by ICP and/or UV-VIS spec- trometry. The zirconium selenomolybdate gel prepared under optimum conditions was characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TGA, DTA), XRD, XRF, and FESEM.

Context: The chemical composition, particularly the Mo con- tent of the zirconium selenomolybdate gel, is a signifi- cant factor for its use as a column matrix in preparation of gel-type 99Mo/99mTc radioisotope generators. The chemical composition of the obtained zirconium se- lenomolybdate materials was studied radiometrically by dissolving the gel materials prepared from the ra- dioactive solution of 95Zr, 99Mo, and 75Se in a hot con- centrated HCl solution. The table compiles the data on the Mo(VI) precipitation yield, the corresponding equi- librium pH value, and some properties of the formed zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo products at the given Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios. As can be seen, the precipitation yield of Mo(VI) from the Mo(VI)– Se(IV)–Zr(IV) mixed solutions decreased with increas- ing Se concentration. The Mo content decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrices, ZSM-1 > ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. This means that the selectivity of the positively charged zirconia surface to molybdate and/ or selenite anionic species depends on their concentra- tion in the mixed solution. At low selenite concentra- tions, the molybdate anions show higher affinity for the positively charged zirconia surface than the se- 2– anions appreciably con- lenite anions do. The SeO3 tribute to the ZSM structure at low Mo(VI) content to keep the zirconia surface neutral. The relative content of Zr(IV) in the gel matrices decreased as the initial concentration of Se(IV) in the mixed solutions in- creased: ZSM-1> ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. In addition, the weight loss of the precipitates dried at 150 and 200°C to constant weight decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrix. Therefore, ZSM-1 sample of zirconium selenomolybdate was chosen for characteri- zation (via IR, thermal analysis, XRD, and FESEM) and further preparation and quality control of 99Mo/99mTc generator. The suggested formula of the formed gel matrices may be written as ZrO(OH)+· (HSeO3)1–x(HMoO4)x·nH2O [21].

Context: gel matrix (ZSM-1) shows the presence of extra water molecules in addition to –OH groups and metal oxides present in the material (Fig. 1). The bands observed at 878 and 722 cm–1 may be due to metal–oxygen bonds, which are manifested in the range 650–1000 cm–1. The band at 1380 cm–1 belongs to bending vibrations of metal-bonded hydroxyl groups. The strong and sharp peak at 1617 cm–1 may be due to HOH bending vibra- tion. The absorption bands at 2900 and 3421 cm–1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of coordinated wa- ter [30, 31]. Figure 2 shows the TG and DTA curves of the zir- conium selenomolybdate gel. The first step in the TG curve between 40–200°C with the weight loss of 11.58% corresponds to the loss of physically adsorbed water and water of crystallization with an endothermic peak in the DTA curve at 125°C. The weight loss in the range 200–440°C was small (2.6%). An endother- mic peak observed at 500.6°C with the weight loss of 11.165% in the range 435–530°C can be assigned to the evaporation of SeO2 and coordinated water and to decomposition of hydroxyl groups. The weight loss in the range 600–900°C was 4.51%. The presence of suit- able amounts of water in the gel material is important to enhance the 99mTc diffusion through the gel material during the elution [32]. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dried zirconium selenomolybdate gel, which shows that it is amorphous. The amorphous structure is much better than the crystalline structure because of more efficient diffusion of the eluent through the amorphous material, increasing the elution yield. The SEM images of the prepared ZSM material at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the gel matrix has a porous basic structure, which makes it good material for diffusion of 99mTc during elution [33].

Context: Elution of 99mTc. Figure 5 shows how the internal diameter of the column and the amount of the matrix influence the 99mTc elution profile. As can be seen, large size of the bed matrix is the major factor influ- encing the 99mTc elution performance. The position of the maximum elution is displaced to higher eluate vol- umes with increasing inside diameter of the column (0.46, 0.6, and 1.1 cm i.d.), i.e., with decreasing height of the zirconium selenomolybdate bed.

Context: Received June 10, 2005 Abstract(cid:0)The reaction cross sections and the energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deuteron energies (<14 MeV) were determined. The specific features of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets were studied in relation to the gas medium composition. The yield of the desired product increases with an increase in the oxygen content in the course of heat treatment of the targets. A simple (cid:0)dry(cid:2) procedure was developed for isolation of 186Re with a yield no less than 85% and radiochemical purity no worse than 99.99%. A proto- type of a cyclotron target for commercial production of the therapeutical radionuclide 186Re was suggested. PACS numbers: 25.45.-z DOI: 10.1134/S1066362206050171 Radioactive isotopes and ionizing radiation sources are widely used in science, industry, engineering, and medicine. In the past two decades, two major trends were steadily observed on the world market of radio- isotopes: decline in the use of fissile radioactive mate- rials and increase in the production of radionuclides for nuclear medicine [1]. Radionuclide therapy is an actively developing field of nuclear medicine. It has doubtless advantages over other kinds of radiation therapy because of low side effects, minimal damage of normal tissues, and possibility of treating metastases and disseminated tumors. Presently the annual volume of sells of radionu- clides for medicine and of radiopharmaceuticals in the United States (45% of the world market in this field) is about $700 mln. American marketing companies expect that by 2015 the annual volume of sells of radionuclides for medicine will increase to $4.5 bln, primarily due to increased production of therapeutical radioisotopes [1]. In the past 3(cid:0) 4 years, the efforts of the leading research laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL, etc.) are focused on the development of processes for production of certain radionuclides (47Sc, 89Sr, 131I, 153Sm, 186Re, 188Re, 213Bi, 211At), among which 186Re occupies a prominent place. The following factors are responsible for the increased interest

Context: This is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 3.78 days) (cid:0) -decay with an (cid:3)impurity(cid:4) of electron undergoing (cid:2) capture (7.47%) [2]. Short path length of the electrons (their maximal energy is 359.2 keV) in living tissues allows destruction of tumors up to 1 mm in diameter. The intrinsic (cid:5)-radiation of the radionuclide (the ener- gy of its main transition, 137.2 keV with an intensity of 9.47%, is approximately the same as that of 99mTc widely used in SPECT, 140.5 keV) is well detected with a commercial scintillation (cid:5)-ray camera and allows efficient monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body. The main goals of this study are as follows: deter- mination of the reaction cross sections and energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deu- teron energies (<14 MeV); study of the specific fea- tures of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets in relation to the gas medium composition; development of a diffusion-thermal procedure for isolating 186Re; mastering of procedures for preparing cyclotron tar- gets from isotopically enriched (186W) powder materi- als; and preliminary radiation and materials-science studies of the new types of the targets.

Context:  The discovered phenomenon formally resembles the classical emanation of inert gases from crystalline salts [14] and release of volatile fission products from UO2 [15]. It should be emphasized that such processes are observed only in systems with polymorphism. In par- in the Sn:113mIn system the release of the ticular, 113mIn atoms into the gas phase starts in the tempera- ture range of the (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:5) polymorphous transition (from 453 K), and in the Cd:111In system no (cid:3)volatili- zation(cid:4) of impurities is observed even at temperatures (575(cid:0)585 K) [16]. approaching the melting point Studies of the emanation in the Sn:113mIn system also showed that the release of the impurity atoms into the gas phase depends on the nuclear and physicochemical history of the sample, conditions of foil annealing, and composition of the gas medium [10, 11]. As in the case of the Sn:113mIn system, in the W:186Re system we also observed the release of daughter atoms into the gas phase, taking place only in a combination with a polymorphous transition. An- nealing of the irradiated metal at temperatures below the phase transition point (<1000 K) was not accom- panied by the egress of 186Re from the bulk of the metal (these experiments were performed only with

Context:  Cross section of the 186W(d, 2n)186Re reaction as a func- tion of deuteron energy: (1) this study, (2) data of [5], and (3) data of [6]. irradiated W powders, because a polymorphous transi- tion in W was discovered only in finely dispersed samples [17]). Heating of irradiated W above the polymorphous transition point (>1000 K) was accompanied by the release of 186Re into the gas phase; the release of the impurity atoms from the bulk of the metal became more active with an increase in the oxygen content in the medium in the course of heat treatment of the targets. In particular, when the irradiated cyclotron (cid:0)4 torr, the release of (cid:0)5(cid:0)10 targets were annealed at 10 (cid:0)2 torr it did not (cid:0)3(cid:0)10 186Re did not exceed 3%, at 10 exceed 15%, and when the samples (W/C composites) were heated in air, the release increased to 65% (typi- cal value for the majority of our experiments). This fact strongly suggests that, along with the emanation occurring at polymorphous transitions, there is some other process facilitating the release of radioactive microimpurities (in the form of volatile rhenium species ReO3, Re2O7) into the gas phase, e.g., their release in the course of cyclic gas transport reactions of the following type: oxidation of irradiated W metal with atmospheric oxygen (cid:7) sublimation of WO3 with the release of impurity 186Re atoms into the gas phase (cid:7) condensation of WO3 on graphite powder followed by its reduction to metal (cid:7) reoxidation of W metal, etc. We took this separation scheme as a basis for a (cid:3)dry(cid:4) process for 186Re production.

It was found that about 30% of americium in the Am(V) oxidation state of its initial content in a model solution containing a salting-out agent (ammonium nitrate) in an amount of 8 M, passes into the organic phase in one stage of extraction with a 30% solution of tributyl phosphate in Isopar-M. In this case, Cm and Pr are extracted by 80–85%. The distribution coeffi cient of Am was about 0.1, of Cm and Pr, about 1, and the separation factor of Am from Cm and Pr was about 10. Thus, the possibility of selective separation of americium from HLW for its subsequent transmutation in fast reactors was demonstrated.

In this case, one of the most important radiochemical problems is the subsequent separation of americium from curium and lanthanides. This separation is necessary for a number of reasons. First, the lanthanides are neutron poisons; some isotopes have a high neutron capture cross section, and their presence in the fuel will inhibit the transmutation of americium [3, 4]. Secondly, the involvement of curium isotopes in a closed nuclear fuel cycle is problematic, since it has a high level of neutron and thermal radiation, which will complicate the manufacture and operation of regenerated homogeneous nuclear fuel or americium targets for its transmutation.

Context: The well-known problem of separating Am, Cm, and lanthanides is caused by the similarity in their chemical properties [5, 6]. TPE and lanthanides are 5f- and 4f-elements, respectively, they are characterized by the fi lling of internal f-orbitals with increasing atomic number, which has little eff ect on the chemical properties that depend mainly on processes in the outer electron shells. In view of this fact, these elements predominantly exist in aqueous solutions in the oxidation state(III). The ionic radii of these cations are also comparable. Americium and curium ions have isostructural analogs in the lanthanide series: r(Nd3+) ≈ r(Am3+), r(Sm3+) ≈ r(Cm3+). Thus, it is diffi cult to separate trivalent Am and Cm from lanthanides by adjusting only the size of the coordination sphere of organic ligands. There are several approaches to the separation of Am from Cm and lanthanides, and most of them are based on extraction methods [7, 8]. The key diff erence between these cations is that americium can be oxidized to higher oxidation states Am(V,VI), which changes its extraction behavior [9, 10]. Previously, in our works [11, 12], it was shown that, generating Am(VI) in weakly acidic solutions makes it possible to extract Cm(III) from their mixture using the extractants 1-phenyl-3-methyl- 4-benzoylpyrosolone-5 and trioctylphosphine oxide, while Am(VI), being reduced by the organic phase to Am(V), remains in the aqueous solution. At the same time, the use of these extractants in industrial conditions is challenging. For this reason, it was proposed [13] to use TBP as a reliable and well-tested extractant in the technology to solve the problem of separating Am from Cm. For example, curium was extracted almost quantitatively from solutions containing ≤0.1 M HNO3 and ~8 M NH4NO3 using 30% TBP in Isopar-M, while americium was only partially (≤30%) transferred to the organic phase in the Am(III) form. In this case, a high degree of separation of Cm from Am(V) remaining in the aqueous phase was attained (≥99.9%). At the moment, only a few other works [14–16] are known on the use of TBP as an extractant for separating Am from other transuranium elements or lanthanides. For example, in [14, 16], it was proposed to extract Am(VI) directly from nitric acid solutions without adding a salting-out agent. Reaching high distribution coeffi cients can be performed by adjusting the solution acidity. At the initial stage, a decrease in acidity is provided for the effi cient oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI), then its increase it to 1 M relative to HNO3. The separation factor for the Am–Nd pair was about 50; therewith separation of the Am–Np pair did not occur. In [15], it was proposed to use dihydrogen phosphate to bind Nd into a more stable complex compared to Am(VI), which allowed to reach a separation factor of about 120. This work is aimed at studying the extraction of Am in higher oxidation states in weakly acidic solutions— simulants of the actinide–lanthanide fraction of a highly active raffi nate, containing americium and curium isotopes and weight amounts of lanthanides (with praseodymium as an example)—using TBP and in the presence of ammonium nitrate as a salting-out agent, not forming insoluble salts with actinides and fi ssion products, including lanthanides.

Context: The well-known problem of separating Am, Cm, and lanthanides is caused by the similarity in their chemical properties [5, 6]. TPE and lanthanides are 5f- and 4f-elements, respectively, they are characterized by the fi lling of internal f-orbitals with increasing atomic number, which has little eff ect on the chemical properties that depend mainly on processes in the outer electron shells. In view of this fact, these elements predominantly exist in aqueous solutions in the oxidation state(III). The ionic radii of these cations are also comparable. Americium and curium ions have isostructural analogs in the lanthanide series: r(Nd3+) ≈ r(Am3+), r(Sm3+) ≈ r(Cm3+). Thus, it is diffi cult to separate trivalent Am and Cm from lanthanides by adjusting only the size of the coordination sphere of organic ligands. There are several approaches to the separation of Am from Cm and lanthanides, and most of them are based on extraction methods [7, 8]. The key diff erence between these cations is that americium can be oxidized to higher oxidation states Am(V,VI), which changes its extraction behavior [9, 10]. Previously, in our works [11, 12], it was shown that, generating Am(VI) in weakly acidic solutions makes it possible to extract Cm(III) from their mixture using the extractants 1-phenyl-3-methyl- 4-benzoylpyrosolone-5 and trioctylphosphine oxide, while Am(VI), being reduced by the organic phase to Am(V), remains in the aqueous solution. At the same time, the use of these extractants in industrial conditions is challenging. For this reason, it was proposed [13] to use TBP as a reliable and well-tested extractant in the technology to solve the problem of separating Am from Cm. For example, curium was extracted almost quantitatively from solutions containing ≤0.1 M HNO3 and ~8 M NH4NO3 using 30% TBP in Isopar-M, while americium was only partially (≤30%) transferred to the organic phase in the Am(III) form. In this case, a high degree of separation of Cm from Am(V) remaining in the aqueous phase was attained (≥99.9%). At the moment, only a few other works [14–16] are known on the use of TBP as an extractant for separating Am from other transuranium elements or lanthanides. For example, in [14, 16], it was proposed to extract Am(VI) directly from nitric acid solutions without adding a salting-out agent. Reaching high distribution coeffi cients can be performed by adjusting the solution acidity. At the initial stage, a decrease in acidity is provided for the effi cient oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI), then its increase it to 1 M relative to HNO3.

However, in some works, contradictions were noted regarding the stability of Am(VI) in the presence of TBP. Thus, the authors of [14, 16] point to the relative stability of Am in the or- ganic phase, while it was stated in [21] that contact with organic phase led to a rapid americium reduction result- ing in a lower D(Am) than expected. Thus, from the data in Table 1, it can be concluded that Am(VI), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, is successfully extracted with 30% TBP in Isopar-M from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of NH4NO3 salting-out agent.

Context:  Fig. 2. Absorption spectra of Am(V) and Pr(III) in 0.1 M HNO3 before (1) and after (2) adding salting-out agent (8 M NH4NO3). The main problem of using Am(V) for its separation from Cm and REE is its reduction to Am(III), which is well extractable under these conditions. The Am(V) reduction occurs under the action of radiolysis products [22], disproportionation of Am(V) [23], and due to contact with organic phase. Selection of the conditions under which the extraction of Am(V) in TBP will be minimal without replacing TBP with the TODGA extractant, which is not yet available for industrial technology, as was done in [24, 25], will make it possible to achieve the quantitative separation of americium from curium, as well from lanthanides. Thus, an important task for future research is the stabilization of americium in its weakly extractable form Am(V).

Context: Abstract—The solvent extraction of the 90Y/90Sr pair from carbonate media with mixtures of aromatic dihydroxy compounds and a quaternary ammonium salt—methyltrioctylammonium carbonate (MTOAC)—in toluene and butyl acetate was studied. It was found that MTOAC increases the distribution coeffi cients of both the extractant itself and its solvate with yttrium due to the formation of a mixed complex of yttrium and a dihydroxyaromatic ligand with MTOAC. During extraction from alkaline carbonate media in the pH range of 12–13.5 with mixtures of 0.01 M 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 0.015 M MTOAC in butyl acetate or toluene, the distribution coeffi cients of yttrium exceed 80; the separation factors of the 90Y/90Sr pair under these conditions are more than 105. Dilute solutions of hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric acids can be used for the complete stripping of yttrium. The studied mixtures are chemically stable and do not change the extraction properties upon multiple extraction/stripping cycles. Model experiments on the leaching of yttrium from natural samples showed that the percentage of stable yttrium extraction from sand is 70–80%, while the percentage of yttrium extraction from soil is 50–60%.

Context: The isotope 90Sr, formed during the fi ssion of uranium and plutonium nuclei, together with 137Cs makes the main contribution to the global pollution of water and soil on Earth. Atmospheric nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility of 90Sr brings about its distribution in the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of living beings, where it concentrates in the bones and damages the surrounding tissues. The obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment is complicated by its nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the matrix material, exposure until equilibrium with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid– liquid extraction is widely used for the separation of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is effi ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2].

Context: Preliminary experiments showed that all the studied aromatic dihydroxy compounds weakly extract yttrium from alkaline media. The low extraction effi ciency may be due to the washing out of the extractant into the aqueous phase because of the formation of hydrophilic sodium phenolates. According to the literature data [5], 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene has pKa1 = 8.8, pKa2 = 12.6, which indicates its complete transition to the monosodium salt in highly alkaline media. The MTOAC cation generates hydrophobic salts with the phenolate anion and helps to reduce the loss of the extractant with the aqueous phase. Figure 1 shows data on the distribution of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and its salt with MTOAC between the organic and aqueous phases. From the data in Fig. 1, it can be seen that at pH below 11, the addition of MTOAC does not signifi cantly aff ect the distribution of 2,3DHN between the aqueous and organic phases. At pH 13.5, the transition of 2,3DHN from butyl acetate into the aqueous phase decreases from 75 to 3.2% in the presence of MTOAC. Obviously, during the yttrium extraction in a strongly alkaline medium, the anionic complex of 2,3DHN with the metal interacts with the MTOAC cation and passes into the organic phase. It should be noted that the yttrium extraction with dihydroxy compounds sharply increases at pH of aqueous solutions above 11 (see below).

The MTOAC cation generates hydrophobic salts with the phenolate anion and helps to reduce the loss of the extractant with the aqueous phase. Figure 1 shows data on the distribution of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and its salt with MTOAC between the organic and aqueous phases. From the data in Fig. 1, it can be seen that at pH below 11, the addition of MTOAC does not signifi cantly aff ect the distribution of 2,3DHN between the aqueous and organic phases. At pH 13.5, the transition of 2,3DHN from butyl acetate into the aqueous phase decreases from 75 to 3.2% in the presence of MTOAC. Obviously, during the yttrium extraction in a strongly alkaline medium, the anionic complex of 2,3DHN with the metal interacts with the MTOAC cation and passes into the organic phase. It should be noted that the yttrium extraction with dihydroxy compounds sharply increases at pH of aqueous solutions above 11 (see below). The optimal ratio of MTOAC/dihydroxy compound, which provides the maximum synergistic eff ect in the Fig. 1. Eff ect of MTOAC on distribution of 2,3DHN between aqueous and organic phases.

Context: yttrium extraction, was determined by the method of isomolar series (Fig. 2). It can be seen that a 1.5- fold excess of MTOAC with respect to 2,3DHN is optimal, which suggests the formation of a solvate of the composition [Y(2,3DHN)2(MTOAC)3] [6]. The existence of a complex of this composition is confi rmed by the MS-ESI(–) data: in addition to the 2,3DHN monoanion (m/z = 159.0448), there is a signal with m/z = 404.8723 of the [Y(2,3DHN)2]– monoanion. The MS- ESI(–) spectra contain signals from anionic complexes, which, in addition to yttrium and 2,3DHN, include carbonate and hydroxyl groups and water molecules. Compared to pure 2,3DHN and MTOAC, their synergistic mixture extracts yttrium with distribution coeffi cients approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher: for 0.005 M MTOAC in PhMe, DY = 0.47, for 0.005 М 2,3DHN DY = 2.5 × 10–5, and for their mixture DY = 32 (Fig. 2). As already noted, the maximum extraction of yttrium by mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with MTOAC is detected at pH above 11. We found that the specifi c form of distribution coeffi cient curve for yttrium vs. pH of the aqueous phase is determined by the type of dihydroxy compound and the type of organic solvent (Fig. 3). The most eff ective extractant in both solvents is 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. The lowest distribution coeffi cients of yttrium, regardless of the type of solvent, are demonstrated by 4-tert-butylpyrocatechol. Its unsubstituted analog, pyrocatechol, extracts yttrium well only into toluene solutions. This may be due to steric factors, since the properties of phenolic groups in these extractants are very similar. High distribution coeffi cients of yttrium were found in a water-soluble chelating agent, alizarin, giving a hydrophobic complex with MTOAC, which is concentrated in the organic phase. A solution of alizarin in butyl acetate upon contact with an aqueous phase with a pH below 12.5 forms a third phase. The possibility of effi cient separation of yttrium and strontium was demonstrated by the example of 2,3DHN, the most effi cient of the studied extractants (Fig. 4). The data in Fig. 4 show that at pH > 12, Y/Sr pair separation factors exceed 105 in both toluene and butyl acetate. Such a high selectivity is unattainable in the extraction of strontium with crown ethers [1] or yttrium with alkyl phosphoric acids [2] from nitric acid solutions. Small diff erences in the behavior of stable and radioactive isotopes are most likely associated with a high error in determining the low activities of 90Sr and 90Y in saline solutions. An additional advantage of the studied extraction systems is the simplicity of yttrium stripping with dilute acid solutions.

Context: gamma radiation during decay into stable 119Sn, does not interfere with medical use of 117mSn. Therefore, the implementation of the nat,123Sb(p,x)117mSn approach on cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type for producing large amounts of 117mSn of medical quality seems especially promising. In [15], we proposed a method for obtaining no-carrier-added 117mSn from a thick target of metallic antimony irradiated with protons. After dissolution of the antimony target, the radiotin was isolated by liquid- liquid extraction (LLE) with dibutyl ether, followed by exhaustive purifi cation on silica gel. The method provides production of up to 3 Ci (100 GBq) 117mSn of high radionuclidic purity with a specifi c activity of about 1000 Ci/g (more than 40 GBq/mg). However, since metallic antimony has low thermal conductivity, low melting point and high vapor pressure, antimony targets cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high-intensity proton currents. In addition, antimony actively interacts with many materials that are usually used for the manufacture of the target shell, which leads to its radiation damage. Instead of metallic antimony, intermetallic compounds, such as TiSb, NiSb, and AlSb, were considered as a target material, of which TiSb turned out to be the most promising [16]. The TiSb properties, unique in many respects, have been studied since the 1950s [17]. The compound combines high stability (the enthalpy of formation is estimated as –167 kJ/mol [18]), and a high melting point of 1160°C with pronounced metallic properties, including high electrical and thermal conductivity. According to our estimate, the value of the latter is twice the thermal conductivity of titanium and antimony taken separately. In the chemical separation of 117mSn from irradiated TiSb, it is necessary to remove not only macro-quantites of antimony, but also macroquantites of titanium. Previously, removal of antimony was studied in [15]. Removal of titanium is diffi cult due to the similarity of its chemical behavior with that of tin; in the few studies described in the literature, extraction and chromatographic separation methods are used. Sn(IV) can be extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone from 7 M HCl solutions, while Ti(IV) remains in the aqueous phase [19]. Then, the tin is reextracted with dilute solutions of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid [20]. In analytical practice, tin is also extracted with benzene from HI solutions. The extraction of tin with

Therefore, the implementation of the nat,123Sb(p,x)117mSn approach on cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type for producing large amounts of 117mSn of medical quality seems especially promising. In [15], we proposed a method for obtaining no-carrier-added 117mSn from a thick target of metallic antimony irradiated with protons. After dissolution of the antimony target, the radiotin was isolated by liquid- liquid extraction (LLE) with dibutyl ether, followed by exhaustive purifi cation on silica gel. The method provides production of up to 3 Ci (100 GBq) 117mSn of high radionuclidic purity with a specifi c activity of about 1000 Ci/g (more than 40 GBq/mg). However, since metallic antimony has low thermal conductivity, low melting point and high vapor pressure, antimony targets cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high-intensity proton currents. In addition, antimony actively interacts with many materials that are usually used for the manufacture of the target shell, which leads to its radiation damage. Instead of metallic antimony, intermetallic compounds, such as TiSb, NiSb, and AlSb, were considered as a target material, of which TiSb turned out to be the most promising [16]. The TiSb properties, unique in many respects, have been studied since the 1950s [17]. The compound combines high stability (the enthalpy of formation is estimated as –167 kJ/mol [18]), and a high melting point of 1160°C with pronounced metallic properties, including high electrical and thermal conductivity. According to our estimate, the value of the latter is twice the thermal conductivity of titanium and antimony taken separately. In the chemical separation of 117mSn from irradiated TiSb, it is necessary to remove not only macro-quantites of antimony, but also macroquantites of titanium. Previously, removal of antimony was studied in [15]. Removal of titanium is diffi cult due to the similarity of its chemical behavior with that of tin; in the few studies described in the literature, extraction and chromatographic separation methods are used.

Context: benzene proceeds most effi ciently at a perchloric acid content of 4.66 M, sulfuric acid content of 1 M (total acidity 6.6 M), and a potassium iodide content of 0.5 M. In this case, titanium and antimony, as well as I–III metals, including indium and scandium, are not extracted [21]. Tin is reextracted with a 1–2 M HCl solution. However, this technique was developed only for the analytical determination of milligram amounts of tin [22]; its applicability for isolation of no-carrier- added radiotin has not been studied. Chromatographic separation of Ti(IV) from ions of other metals is possible by sorption of titanium in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on a weakly basic anion exchanger Amberlite CG-4B [23]. A similar behavior of Ti(IV) is observed on AG 50W-X8 and Dowex 50W cation exchangers in 0.05 M H2SO4 solutions with the addition of 1% H2O2 [24]. Ti(IV) is not adsorbed on strongly basic anion-exchange resins (Dowex 1×8 and AG 1 × 8) [25]. As known, Ti forms peroxide complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+, positively charged and stable in strongly acidic solutions. At the same time, Sn forms the anionic complex [SnCl6]2– in strong hydrochloric acid solutions; therefore, the separation of oppositely charged Sn and Ti complexes can be carried out both on cation-exchange and anion-exchange resins. For example, when a hydrochloric acid solution of Sn and Ti containing a minor excess of H2O2, is passed through an anion-exchange resin, [SnCl6]2– anions are adsorbed, whereas [TiO(H2O2)] cations pass through the column. Then, tin is desorbed by passing through the column solutions that decompose the [SnCl6]2– anionic complex. For separating trace amounts of tin from macroquantites of titanium, this method is preferable, since it does not require large volumes of sorbent. Basically, the methods presented in the literature have been developed for the separation of macroquantities of Sn, Sb, and Ti, while the behavior of radionuclides in the “no-carrier-added” state can diff er signifi cantly. When producing 117mSn of high specifi c activity, it is necessary to separate the macroquantites of Sb and Ti from the ul- tramicroquantities of Sn. In addition, proton irradiation of antimony and titanium produces other radionuclides, capable of aff ecting purity of the target product, and they must also be separated from tin. In this study, we propose options for the extraction of 117mSn with a high specifi c activity from the proton-irradiated antimony– titanium intermetallic compound to prepare RP.

Antimony–titanium intermetallic compound was formed by argon-arc melting of antimony and titanium powder in a molar ratio of 1: 1 [16]. To prepare the target, the crushed intermetallide was placed in an electron-beam welded titanium container 5 mm thick and was heated at a temperature of 910°C and a pressure of 150 MPa in argon for 1.5 h [26]. To produce radionuclides and study their chemical behavior, targets from the TiSb intermetallic compound and also from metallic antimony were irradiated. The activity of the used radionuclides was in the range of several μCi (~ 100 kBq).

Context: Preparation and irradiation of experimental targets. The radionuclides 124Sb (carrier-added), 113Sn, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn (no-carrier-added) used in this study for model experiments were obtained from irradiated antimony targets by the method described in [9]. 44Ti was supplied by CJSC Cyclotron (Obninsk). Antimony–titanium intermetallic compound was formed by argon-arc melting of antimony and titanium powder in a molar ratio of 1: 1 [16]. To prepare the target, the crushed intermetallide was placed in an electron-beam welded titanium container 5 mm thick and was heated at a temperature of 910°C and a pressure of 150 MPa in argon for 1.5 h [26]. To produce radionuclides and study their chemical behavior, targets from the TiSb intermetallic compound and also from metallic antimony were irradiated. The activity of the used radionuclides was in the range of several μCi (~ 100 kBq). Irradiation was carried out at a high-precision accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research (Troitsk, Moscow) with the initial proton beam energy varied from 110 to 140 MeV and at the current 1–50 μA [27]. Materials and reagents. For preparing aqueous solutions, we used concentrated acids (HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4) and deionized water from a Millipore Simplicity water purifi cation unit. Antimony was extracted with dibutyl ether. For chromatographic separation of titanium, we used: (1) strongly basic monofunctional anionites AG 1×8 (Bio Rad, USA) and Dowex 1×8 (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –N+(CН3)3 as the mai functional group; (2) Dowex 50×8 cation exchanger (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –SO3H as the main functional group.

The content of Ti varied from 1.5 to 30 g/L, the Sb content varied from (2–5)×10–3 g/L, a value corresponding to the addition of the 124Sb label, to 14.4 g/L, the H2O2 : Ti molar ratio was from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1. The label was obtained from an irradiated antimony target. The sorption and desorption of tin was performed under dynamic conditions by passing the solution through a column (d = 0.6 cm) with a sorbent layer 6 cm high. Two anion-exchange resins were used as sorbents: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Before fi lling the column, the sorbents were kept in 6 M HCl for 12 h. First, 10 mL of the initial solution was passed through the fi lled column at a rate of 0.8 mL/min and then 40–50 mL of a 6 M HCl washing solution passed. For desorption of radiotin, 1–4 M HNO3 solutions were used. Model solutions used for extraction have a total acidity of 6.6 M and a volume of 30 mL and contain 4.66 М HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, Ti (20 g/L), Sb in the form of antimony chloride with a concentration from (2– 5)×10–3 to 1 g/L, and 0.2–1 М KI. Also, (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn) produced from the irradiated antimony target was added to the model solution as label.

Context: Isolation of no-carrier-added 117mSn from an irradiated antimony target is not an easy task, since these elements have similar chemical behavior. In the case of the separation of 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound, the task is complicated by the need to purify also from titanium, which also exhibits chemical properties close to that of tin. Therefore, the main task of this study was the effi cient separation, providing a high chemical yield, of radiotin from the macrocomponents of antimony and titanium. For purifi cation from the main amount of antimony in the presence of titanium, we used extraction with dibutyl ether, which was described previously in the absence of titanium in [15]. Extraction was performed from a model 10 M HCl solution containing 55 g/L Sb, 20 g/L Ti, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, and 44Ti) (Table 2). The study showed that following three successive extractions, more than 99.7% of antimony passes into dibutyl ether, while radiotin and titanium remain in the aqueous phase. After the fi rst stage of extraction, the concentration of antimony decreases to 1.5 g/L. After three stages, it may be reduced to 0.1 g/ L. More than 95% of titanium and radiotin remain in the aqueous phase. It was found that the extraction of antimony in the presence of titanium proceeds in the same way as in its absence.

Score: 29.92



Context: Isolation of no-carrier-added 117mSn from an irradiated antimony target is not an easy task, since these elements have similar chemical behavior. In the case of the separation of 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound, the task is complicated by the need to purify also from titanium, which also exhibits chemical properties close to that of tin. Therefore, the main task of this study was the effi cient separation, providing a high chemical yield, of radiotin from the macrocomponents of antimony and titanium. For purifi cation from the main amount of antimony in the presence of titanium, we used extraction with dibutyl ether, which was described previously in the absence of titanium in [15]. Extraction was performed from a model 10 M HCl solution containing 55 g/L Sb, 20 g/L Ti, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, and 44Ti) (Table 2). The study showed that following three successive extractions, more than 99.7% of antimony passes into dibutyl ether, while radiotin and titanium remain in the aqueous phase. After the fi rst stage of extraction, the concentration of antimony decreases to 1.5 g/L. After three stages, it may be reduced to 0.1 g/ L. More than 95% of titanium and radiotin remain in the aqueous phase. It was found that the extraction of antimony in the presence of titanium proceeds in the same way as in its absence. For the subsequent purifi cation of radiotin from titanium macroquantities, both chromatography on strong anion exchangers with the addition of hydrogen peroxide and extraction with benzene from iodide solutions were used.

Context: of positively charged complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+. These complexes are stable in acidic media, including HCl, in which tin forms the anionic complexes [SnCl6]2–. Our preliminary experiments showed that Ti macroquantities are not sorbed from 2 M HCl and are not completely sorbed from 1 M HCl. The ion-exchange separation of radiotin from titanium was carried out from 0.5 M HCl, while the titanium concentration was reduced by a factor of 20. However, this method is not entirely suitable for solving our problem, since large volumes of sorbent are required to remove macroamounts of titanium, which should be disposed and lead to the loss of radiotin. The separation of radiotin from titanium on strongly basic anion exchangers turned out to be more promising approach. The above possibility was studied on model solutions. The chromatographic procedure consisted of passing a hydrochloric acid solution of radiotin and titanium, containing a small stoichiometric excess of H2O2, through an anion exchange resin. In this case, [SnCl6]2– anions were sorbed on the column, while [TiO(H2O2)]2+ cations passed through the column. The column was washed with 6 M HCl to remove titanium. The titanium concentration in the washing solution and, as a consequence, in the target product depended on the degree of purifi cation of the initial solution from macroamounts of antimony (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that an increase in the antimony concentration has adverse eff ect on the purifi cation from titanium. Next, we compared the effi ciency of purifi cation of radiotin from titanium, tellurium, and antimony residues on two strongly basic anion exchangers: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8.

Context:  – selective elution of titanium with respect to radiotin should be carried out in a 6 M HCl (for a chromatographic column volume of 2.5–3 mL and a sorbent layer height of 6–7 cm, 50 mL of 6 M HCl is suffi cient). For desorption of radiotin, a 2 M HNO3 solution heated to 40°C should be used; with the above column parameters, 25 mL of 2 M HNO3 is suffi cient to extract 98–99% of the radiotin. The purifi cation factor from Ti depends on its concentration in the initial solution and reaches 104 at a titanium concentration of 25 g/L; a purifi cation factor of up to 106 may be achieved after two stages of chromatographic purifi cation. Extraction separation of radiotin from titanium. Along with the chromatographic method, extraction methods are also used to separate radiotin from titanium macroquantities. One of these methods is extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone [19]. Our model experiments showed that methyl isobutyl ketone extracts up to 80% of radiotin from 7 M HCl, while the titanium concentration decreases 200 times. The extraction of radiotin from a solution of 7 M Another extraction method of separation from titanium, providing up to 99-% yield, is the extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions. This method was studied for the separation of milligram amounts of tin from titanium and antimony in [21]. The behavior of a no-carrier-added tin may diff er from the behavior of macroscopic amounts of tin. The diff erence in the extraction behavior of tin is mainly infl uenced by the concentration of stable antimony and iodide ions. It was shown in [15] that after the removal of antimony by extraction with dibutyl ether, a minor amount of it nevertheless remains in the solution. At the fi rst stage, the eff ect of the concentration of antimony in the initial solution on the extraction of radiotin with benzene was studied. In this case, the KI concentration was kept constant (0.5 M). In the studied range of antimony concentrations (2–5) × 10–3–1 g/L, at least 98% of radiotin is extracted with two 10-mL portions of benzene. The dependence of the extraction of antimony on its concentration in the initial solution is demonstrated in Fig. 5. As seen, the more antimony in the initial solution, the more it is extracted into the organic phase (salting out eff ect). Therefore, the antimony concentration should be minimal.

The diff erence in the extraction behavior of tin is mainly infl uenced by the concentration of stable antimony and iodide ions. It was shown in [15] that after the removal of antimony by extraction with dibutyl ether, a minor amount of it nevertheless remains in the solution. At the fi rst stage, the eff ect of the concentration of antimony in the initial solution on the extraction of radiotin with benzene was studied. In this case, the KI concentration was kept constant (0.5 M). In the studied range of antimony concentrations (2–5) × 10–3–1 g/L, at least 98% of radiotin is extracted with two 10-mL portions of benzene. The dependence of the extraction of antimony on its concentration in the initial solution is demonstrated in Fig. 5. As seen, the more antimony in the initial solution, the more it is extracted into the organic phase (salting out eff ect). Therefore, the antimony concentration should be minimal.

Loss on the sediment formed in the organic phase after extraction and on the surface of chemical glassware. Curve: (1) antimony (124Sb) and (2) 113Sn. For reextraction of radiotin from the organic phase, we used 1.5 M HCl and 0.25 M H2SO4 solutions proposed in the literature [22]. The effi ciencies of reextraction with solutions of both acids were found to be close. Since further purifi cation was performed in hydrochloric acid solutions, 1.5 M HCl was used for reextraction. The infl uence of the initial concentration of antimony on the reextraction was investigated. In particular, it was shown that with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, the purifi cation degree of radiotin, reextracted from benzene, from titanium also decreases (Fig. 5). It was found that after a certain time (within an hour) elapsed after extraction, a white precipitate formed in the organic phase. For tin rextraction, the organic phase was decanted, with some radiotin remaining on the sediment and on the surface of the chemical glassware (Fig. 6). The infl uence of the concentration of antimony and iodide ions in the initial solution on the loss of radionu- clides in the sediment was studied. As seen, the loss of ra- diotin in the sediment increases with increasing antimony concentration (Fig. 6). To minimize the loss, it is neces- sary to limit the interval between extraction and reextrac- tion, and also to reduce the concentration of antimony in the initial solution to 0.1 g/L. But even at this minimum concentration the amount of precipitate increases with an increase in the KI concentration.

Context: extracted in signifi cant quantities, antimony remains the only macrocomponent that can lead to insoluble com- pounds. Based on the fact that the content of antimony in the precipitate increases with concentrations of both antimony and KI, it can be assumed that the precipitate is Sb(V) iodide or its derivatives. The eff ect of the concentration of iodide ions on the course of extraction was studied at the constant concentration of antimony in the initial solution equal to 0.1 g/L. It was found that, in the concentration range studied, 0.2–1 M, the KI concentration dramatically aff ects the extraction of radiotin and antimony: at low concentra- tions, antimony is extracted, while up to 70% of radiotin remains in the aqueous phase. With an increase in the KI concentration, the behavior of the elements changes: the radiotin quantitatively leaves the aqueous phase, while the antimony remains (Fig. 7). Analysis of the obtained experimental data showed that more than 98% of titani- um and tellurium radionuclides remained in the aqueous phase after extraction with benzene. In addition, iodide ions contribute to a more complete separation of radio- tin from titanium. With KI concentration increased from 0.2 to 1 mol/L, the degree of purifi cation from titanium is increased by a factor of 4–5.

Context:  Thus, titanium can be almost completely removed from radiotin by extraction with benzene, whereas trace amounts of antimony and tellurium present in the product may be removed by chromatographic purifi cation on silica gel. On processing an irradiated antimony target, such a fi nal purifi cation was performed in a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5), which, in turn, was prepared from a 10 M HCl solution, which is determined by the previous stage of processing described in [15]. In the case of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, a sodium citrate solution was prepared from a 1.5 M HCl solution, and in the case of chromatographic separation on AG 1 × 8 resin, the preceding solution was 2 M HNO3, not HCl. We checked how traces of nitrate ions aff ect the chromatography effi ciency on silica gel, the formation of antimony complexes with citrate ions in particular. To do this, a citrate solution containing 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was prepared starting from a 2 M HNO3. The solution was passed through a column fi lled with SiO2, then the column was washed, and radiotin was eluted with 6 M HCl according to the method described in [15]. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 8. It follows from Fig. 5 that the radionuclides Sn, Sb, and Te behave in the same way, as in the absence of nitrate aions. In this case, about 45% of 44Ti remains on the column. Isolation of radiotin from an irradiated TiSb sample. After the process of radiotin separation was studied in model experiments, an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound was fabricated and irradiated. The chemical and physical properties of TiSb have been little studied. To study the interaction of TiSb with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were successively dissolved in concentrated HCl and then in concentrated HCl with the addition of HNO3. Heating TiSb in concentrated hydrochloric acid caused solution to turn violet (owing to the formation of Ti3+ ions). As the sample dissolved, the reaction rate decreased. The addition of H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 leads to the resumption of dissolution. However, in this case, Ti3+ transforms into Ti4+, causing precipitation and passivation of the TiSb surface.

The chemical and physical properties of TiSb have been little studied. To study the interaction of TiSb with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were successively dissolved in concentrated HCl and then in concentrated HCl with the addition of HNO3. Heating TiSb in concentrated hydrochloric acid caused solution to turn violet (owing to the formation of Ti3+ ions). As the sample dissolved, the reaction rate decreased. The addition of H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 leads to the resumption of dissolution. However, in this case, Ti3+ transforms into Ti4+, causing precipitation and passivation of the TiSb surface. We succeeded in performing complete dissolution as follows. The bead of the compound was placed in a fl ask, and a concentrated HCl was added. The fl ask was heated for 12 h at refl ux temperature. Solution (no. 1) turned deep violet, indicating the formation of Ti3+ ions. Then, the insoluble residue was transferred into a fl ask with a fresh portion of concentrated HCl, and

Context:  Thus, titanium can be almost completely removed from radiotin by extraction with benzene, whereas trace amounts of antimony and tellurium present in the product may be removed by chromatographic purifi cation on silica gel. On processing an irradiated antimony target, such a fi nal purifi cation was performed in a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5), which, in turn, was prepared from a 10 M HCl solution, which is determined by the previous stage of processing described in [15]. In the case of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, a sodium citrate solution was prepared from a 1.5 M HCl solution, and in the case of chromatographic separation on AG 1 × 8 resin, the preceding solution was 2 M HNO3, not HCl. We checked how traces of nitrate ions aff ect the chromatography effi ciency on silica gel, the formation of antimony complexes with citrate ions in particular. To do this, a citrate solution containing 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was prepared starting from a 2 M HNO3. The solution was passed through a column fi lled with SiO2, then the column was washed, and radiotin was eluted with 6 M HCl according to the method described in [15]. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 8. It follows from Fig. 5 that the radionuclides Sn, Sb, and Te behave in the same way, as in the absence of nitrate aions.

Column 0.8 cm in diameter and 8 cm in height, fl ow rate 0.8 mL/min. a concentrated HNO3 was added dropwise on heating. Violent dissolution and formation of a white suspension was observed. After 4 h, dissolution was complete. After cooling the thus obtained solution (no. 2), the precipitate was fi ltered off. To the solution (no. 1) a fi ltered solution (no. 2) was added. This method was used to dissolve an experimental TiSb sample irradiated in an accelerator. It was shown that radiotin is not adsorbed on the formed sediment at the acidity above 3 M HCl. The composite solution was transferred into a 10 M HCl solution, and macroquantites of antimony were removed by extraction with dibutyl ether. Since model experiments demonstrated the possibility of purifi cation from titanium macroquantities both by extraction and by chromatography, the solution obtained after removing antimony was divided into two portions to test both methods. The fi rst portion was purifi ed from titanium on a chromatographic column, and the second portion, by extraction with benzene from iodide solutions. For chromatographic purifi cation on an AG 1 × 8 column, the solution was diluted to 6 M HCl. Results of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and Ti are demonstrated in Fig. 9.

In the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, the best results were achieved for the extraction of radiotin with benzene from a solution containing a mixture of perchloric and sulfuric acids and iodide ions with a concentration of 0.5–1 M. Each of the methods used has its own advantages and disadvantages [30]. In our case, the advantage of extraction in comparison with chromatography is the short time of the process, and the disadvantage is a slightly lower yield of radiotin and worsening of its purifi cation from titanium at a residual concentration of antimony in the initial solution above 0.1 g/L. In our opinion, the method of titanium separation on the AG 1 × 8 anion exchanger is most preferable, since it, although being more time-consuming, is less sensi- tive to the antimony content in the initial solution (about 1 g/L), and is also easier-to-implement in hot chambers. In both methods, the separation of radiotin was terminated by chromatographic purifi cation on silica gel from a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate at pH 5.5. As a result, the 117mSn product with high radionuclidic purity and high specifi c activity was obtained in at least 75-% yield, which is promising for the development of production technology of 117mSn in large quantities in the future.

In both methods, the separation of radiotin was terminated by chromatographic purifi cation on silica gel from a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate at pH 5.5. As a result, the 117mSn product with high radionuclidic purity and high specifi c activity was obtained in at least 75-% yield, which is promising for the development of production technology of 117mSn in large quantities in the future.

Context:  Abstract(cid:0)Diffusion-thermal procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I for radionuclide therapy and positron emission tomography are suggested. For these procedures, new cyclotron targets of metallic tantalum were developed, which, when exposed to high irradiation doses, ensure the absence of physicochemical interaction (diffusion, alloying) of materials being activated and final products with the support at high temperatures. The thermal, hydrodynamic, and strength characteristics of zinc and tellurium (elemental Te) cyclotron targets were evaluated. For commercial target assembly of the COSTIS system, the operation parameters of the proc- ess for preparing 124I from elemental tellurium using the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerators were determined. Recent efforts of leading scientific laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Hammersmith Hospital, etc.) were focused on the development of procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I [1(cid:0)3]. This is due to the unique nuclear-physical properties of 67Cu and 124I, possibility of their production on compact cyclotrons, accelerators of high-energy charged particles, electron accelerators, and moderate-power reactors, and also to rich and well-studied chemistry of these elements. 67Cu is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 2.58 days) undergoing (cid:2)-decay (100%) [4]. A short path of elec- trons with the energy from 181.5 to 575.0 keV in a living body allows elimination of tumors with a diam- eter of up to 5 mm [5]. The inherent (cid:3)-ray radiation of this radionuclide, whose energy spectrum and quan- tum yield (see below) are similar to those of 67Ga widely used in single-photon emission tomography, is efficiently registered with a commercial scintillation (cid:3)-ray chamber providing reliable monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body. E(cid:2), keV (%) [4] 390.4 (57.2) 481.7 (21.6) 575.0 (20.0) 181.5 (1.1) E(cid:3), keV (%) [4] 184.6 (48.7) 93.3 (16.1) 91.3 (7.0) One more undeniable advantage of 67Cu is forma- tion of stable compounds with monoclonal antibodies, which provides target transport of radiopharmaceuti- cals (RPs) to the affected organ, high radiation doses within this organ, very low irradiation of intact tissues, and restricted capacity of tumor cells to regenerate the DNA structure after irradiation with electrons. 124I is a positron emitter. Replacement of the key diagnostic radionuclide iodine-123 by 124I in known RPs such as solution of sodium iodide, solution of sodium o-iodohippurate, m-iodobenzylguanidine, and Iodofen would substantially improve these prepara- tions.

Context: Irrespective of the procedure of radionuclide ac- cumulation, 67Cu can be isolated by vacuum distilla- tion separation of the irradiated zinc targets performed at temperature and pressure providing their complete removal and excluding evaporation of the desired product. This procedure is based on the difference of the evaporation rates and partial vapor pressures of the elements being separated over the solid phase [13]. This method requires changes in the common design of the cyclotron targets (copper or silver sup- ports with deposited isotope material; their modifica- tion should exclude physicochemical interaction (dif- fusion, alloying) of the material being activated and final radionuclides with the support material at elevated temperatures. One of possible solutions is preparation of the targets from inert high-melting materials. Special cyclotron supports were developed for ir- radiation of zinc targets in derived beams of domestic reactors (e.g., U-120 reactor of the St. Petersburg University). In this target, the material to be activated is deposited on a thin (750 (cid:5)m) tantalum support (24 mm in diameter); the (cid:6)loss(cid:7) in the thermal con- ductivity of tantalum as compared to silver and zinc is compensated by optimal combination of the strength and mechanical properties.

Context:  The optimal energy of protons and the yields of the final product and impurity 123I were evaluated using the reference data [7]. However, the data on the in- dustrial production of 124I at the Hammersmith Hos- pital (London, the United Kingdom) [3] showed that the absolute yields of 124I given in this handbook are underestimated by a factor of almost 3.5. For example, the yield of 124I at irradiation of the enriched tellurium target with 12.5-MeV protons is 2.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, and not 0.76 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, as given above. At the same time, the ratios of 124I and 123I are similar: only 2% of 123I is remains in the target after irradiation of the enriched tellurium (99.8%) target.

Context: (Rules and Regulations in Nuclear Power Engineer- ing, hereinafter PNAE) [16]. Criteria for selection of the support material. Comparative analysis of thermal and mechanical prop- erties of these metals (V, Nb, Ta) [6] and typical products of nuclear reactions showed that metallic tan- talum is the best support material for elemental tel- lurium. As compared to commonly used materials (Ag, Cu, Al, Pt), the loss in the thermal conductivity can be compensated by a decrease in the target thick- ness owing to higher strength properties of tantalum. The main aim of this part of the study was to deter- mine the process parameters of preparing 124I under the conditions of operation of the industrial target as- sembly of the COSTIS system (COmpact Solid Target Irradiation System) for the derived beam of the IBA Cyclone 18/9 accelerator. Main parameters of thermal processes in the course of irradiation of tellurium target on tan- talum support are given in Table 2. All further calculations were carried out taking into the data on the operation conditions and account geometric size of the target assembly of the COSTIS system (Fig. 3). In our calculations we used the following data: size of the support disc (24 mm in diameter, 2 mm thick), diameter of the effective irradiation area (12 mm), size of the inlet titanium foil (12 mm in diameter, 0.05 mm thick); temperature of the target assembly (15(cid:0)30(cid:8)C), helium flow rate (25 l min(cid:2)1), water flow rate (16 l min(cid:2)1), and water pressure (0.5 MPa). Since the tellurium target is cooled from the op- posite sides with water and helium, maximal tempera- tures are observed in the material bulk and not on the target surface. The coefficient of heat transfer at the tellurium(cid:0)helium boundary can be calculated only when the helium pressure is known (or set); it can be calculated taking into account the size of titanium window and the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 Calculations of the main characteristics of the helium heat exchanger. Helium heat exchanger is a diffuser(cid:0)confuser. Arrangement of the tellurium and titanium surfaces in the area of this unit strongly intensifies the heat exchange; the diffuser divergence (or confuser convergence) angles in the direction of titanium increase the coefficient of heat transfer at the helium(cid:0)titanium boundary, providing more efficient cooling. At a proton beam current of 15 (cid:5)A, the foil re- ceives 11.2 W and can be cooled by helium convec- tion (at a helium pressure PHe 30 mm Hg) if its mech- anical contact with the stainless-steel frame of the heat exchanger is efficient. With a decrease in the working pressure from 30 to 20 mm Hg, the temperature of the titanium foil de- creases from 136 to 112 (cid:8)C, and the conditional coef- ficient of the pressure reserve increases by a factor of almost 2. However, operation under such conditions is impossible because of the extremely high helium flow velocity (1306 m s(cid:2)1 at PHe < 25 mm Hg) exceeding the speed of sound ((cid:9)1060 m s(cid:2)1). Our calculations of the helium pressures in accor- dance with the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 [16] showed that the titanium foil can operate at a helium pressure of 30 mm Hg. The maximal working stresses are smaller than 100 MPa at a maximal tem- perature of the titanium window of 138(cid:8)C.

Context:  Using the procedure for longitudinal flow along an impermeable plate [17, 18], we determined the coeffi- cients of heat transfer of tantalum in water of 98 000 (cid:0) 67 200 W m(cid:2)2 K(cid:2)1, decreasing in the direction from the center. Taking into account these coefficients, we found that the maximal temperature in the irradiated layer of elemental tellurium is lower than 545.6 K (272.6(cid:8)C). Thus, our calculations showed the principal suit- ability of the target of elemental tellurium deposited on a tantalum support; the most dangerous cross sec- tion of the support operates under the compression conditions, which allows the beam current to be in- creased to 20 (cid:5)A. To decrease the deflection of the tantalum support (i.e., to eliminate the possibility of exfoliation of elemental tellurium), its thickness can be increased to 1(cid:0)1.5 mm.

Context: Because of weak interaction between the elements, formation of a strong tellurium coating directly on tantalum is impossible. Thus, it is necessary to make a thin intermediate layer providing sufficient diffusion junction of the composite without affecting the heat transfer. The material of this layer should be characterized by the intermediate (between Ta and Te) coefficients of linear thermal expansion, fairly high thermal con- ductivity (to provide satisfactory heat removal during irradiation), ability to form strong coatings on the tan- talum surface, high adhesion to tellurium to prepare strong coatings withstanding repeated cycles of irra- diation and thermal treatment of the targets, and absence of the volatile products of nuclear reactions proceeding in the course of proton irradiation. Metallic Ni is the most appropriate for this pur- pose: LCTEs of Ta, Ni, and Te (K(cid:2)1) are 6.79 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 (373(cid:0) 673 K), 13.2 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 (143(cid:0) 693 K), and 17.0 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 K(cid:2)1 (273(cid:0)373 K), respectively [6]; the heat con- ductivities of Ta, Ni, and Te (W m(cid:2)1 K(cid:2)1), 45.3(cid:0)53.6 (273(cid:0) 673 K), 67.0 (cid:0)71.4 (293(cid:0)500 K), and 1.8(cid:0)1.34 (350(cid:0)700 K), respectively [6]. High mutual solubility of Ta and Ni and Ni and Te [19] should provide the required diffusion junction of the elements and stabil- ity of the final three-layer composite in the repeated cycles of irradiation and thermal treatment. Irradiation of nickel with protons yields radionuclides of cobalt and copper, whose vapor pressure at 700 K is less than 1 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)16 atm [6]. The optimal procedure to prepare the intermediate layer of 3(cid:0)5 (cid:5)m thickness is electroplating, nickel which is widely used in mechanical engineering. Then, the layer of elemental tellurium can be depos- ited by fusion in an inert atmosphere.

Context: divinylbenzene copolymer was used as a carrier. The TODGA content in the sorbent was 40 wt %, the granule size was 0.315–0.50 mm. For purifi cation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column lled with AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent, the volume fi of the sorbent in the column was 4 cm3. Before the experiments, the sorbent was treated in a column with a 5 M nitric acid solution for 2 h. At the sorption stage the initial solution was passed through the column at a rate of 6.0 column volumes per an hour [(c.v.)/h]. The fi ltrate at the column outlet was collected and tested for the amounts of chemical impurities. After the end of the sorption, a 3 M HCl solution was passed through the column at a rate of 3.0 c.v./h to remove the initial solution residues. Desorption of 90Y was performed with 0.01 M HCl.

Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The sorption method was tested for direct separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair without using the extraction method. The sorption completeness of 90Y and 90Sr on the fi rst column fi lled with phosphate cation exchange resin D5041 can be evidenced by the change in the relative beta activity (A/Ain) of the fi ltrate over 35–50 days. The results are shown in Fig. 2a, curve 1. These results demonstrate that sorption from a 0.01 M HNO3 solution is accompanied by the combined sorption of 90Sr and 90Y. The relative beta activity of the fi ltrate changes relatively little over time and its equilibrium value is about 20% of the initial value. With an increase in the nitric acid concentration the time dependence of the A/Ain value of the fi ltrate changes sharply. At a 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 concentration at fi rst the A/Ain value is ~0.4, and the equilibrium value, 0.8–0.9.

Context: The above is confi rmed by the time dependences of the relative beta activity of hydrochloric acid desorbates (3 M) obtained after sorption with a D5041 cation exchange resin from solutions with diff erent HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 2b). Figures 2b shows, for clarity, the calculated decay curve of pure radionuclide 90Y calculated according to the radioactive decay law. The results on Fig. 2b show that hydrochloric acid desorbates obtained after the 90Sr/90Y pair sorption by the D5041 cation exchange resin from 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 solutions and washing with HCl solutions of the same concentrations contain almost pure 90Y. The residual activity of desorbates after keeping for 45 days does not exceed 0.1% of the initial activity of the solution, and the experimental and calculated decomposition curves of desorbates almost completely coincide. Due to the fact that even deeper purifi cation of 90Y from 90Sr is required for use in the production of radiopharmaceuticals, the obtained hydrochloric acid desorbates were subjected to additional purifi cation with the TODGA-containing sorbent AXIONIT MND 40T. Sorbents of this type are capable of effi cient sorption of REE and Y in strongly acidic media including hydrochloric acid. In acid solutions with a concentration of less than 0.1 M the sorption of REE(Y) sharply decreases, which makes it possible to carry out their desorption.

Context: solutions with a concentration above 3 M the complete yttrium extraction occurs, while the sorption of strontium and corrosion products on this sorbent practically does not occur. This allows at the sorption stage to carry out deep purifi cation of 90Y from 90Sr and a wide range of chemical impurities (chromium, manganese, nickel, lead, iron, zirconium). The unique sorption properties of the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent make it possible to aff ord pure 90Y radiopharmaceuticals without employing the extraction method that is complex in hardware implementation. At the fi rst stage of the process, selective sorption of 90Y from weakly acidic media is carried out on a phosphate cation exchange resin, where the main part of 90Sr is separated and passed into the fi ltrate. Desorption of 90Y from the phosphate cation exchange resin with 3 M HCl and then 90Y sorption from the hydrochloric acid desorbate on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent allow deep purifi cation both from residual amounts of 90Sr and from chemical impurities of corrosion products. Elution of 90Y from the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent is easily carried out with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, which is the preferred medium for obtaining 90Y-based radiopharmaceuticals.

Most authors believe that the extractant is present in the organic phase as a dimer (HA)2 [15], since the dimerization constants of P507 and Cyanex-272 are very high (log K = 20 and 4.2, respectively [16]). In the separation of rare earth elements with P507 solutions in the range of HNO3 concentrations not higher than 4 M, a linear relationship between the logarithms of Yb and Lu distribution coeffi cients and the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration is observed with a slope close to –3 (Fig. 1), which allows the reaction equation to be applied: The deviation from the linearity (Fig. 1) at a concentration of 4 M HNO3 and higher may be due to the transition to extraction by the solvate (donor- acceptor) mechanism, which occurs, for example, in the extraction of REE with HDEHP solutions from acidic media [17, 18]. It is assumed that from 1 to 3 extractant molecules take part in the formation of the solvate [19], however, in view of the insignifi cance of this reaction contribution to the overall extraction mechanism and the lack of data at higher HNO3 concentrations, the value of m was taken equal to 1, as in [4].

It is known that the use of heavy fl uorinated diluents, for example, F3, also leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeffi cients; therefore, it was of interest to study the eff ect of this diluent on the REE extraction with P507 solutions. The nature of the relationship between the REE distribution coeffi cients and the HNO3 concentration in the extraction of Yb and Lu with P507 solutions in F3 does not depend on the nature of the diluent (Fig. 3), however, the infl uence of the solvation mechanism starts to manifest itself somewhat earlier (from 3 M HNO3) than in the case of extraction with Р507 solutions in isopar M. The curve of the distribution coeffi cients of ytterbi- um and lutetium vs. the P507 concentration in isopar-M constructed in logarithmic coordinates (Fig. 4) have a linear form with a slope close to 2, and not to 3, which may be a consequence of an increase in the degree of association of extractant molecules with a growth in its concentration. This fact leads to a decrease in the REE extraction constants with a rise in the P507 concentra- tion (Table 1). The concentration equilibrium constants of Eq.

Context:  It is known that the use of bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) as an extractant instead of P507 leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeffi cients by approximately 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining high values of the separation factors [20, 21].

In contrast to the system with P507, the functions of the logarithms of the Yb and Lu distribution coeffi cients vs. the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration at a concentration of less than 1 M in this system have a slope of about –2.5 (Fig. 6), which results in the need to apply for simulation of the REE extraction in this region not only Eq.

Context:  Extraction systems for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium based on acidic organophosphorus extractants P507 and Cyanex-272 from nitric acid solutions have been studied. In the course of the experiments, results were found both with the use of a light diluent (Isopar M) and a heavy diluent F3. The separation factors of lutetium and ytterbium in the studied extraction systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained experimental data on the extraction of lutetium and ytterbium with P507 were used to construct a mathematical model that makes it possible to predict the behavior of Yb and Lu in the extraction cascade. A special report will be devoted to testing technological regimes for the lutetium and ytterbium separation.
