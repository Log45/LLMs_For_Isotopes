Context: Abstract—Extraction systems based on extraction of tetraﬂ uoroboric acid (HBF4) with tributyl phosphate (TBP) and triamylphosphine oxide (TAPO) for boron isotope separation were studied. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid was studied in comparison with boric acid (H3BO3). The extraction isotherms at 20°C for four systems (boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids extracted with TBP and TAPO in o-xylene) were obtained, and single-stage isotope separation factors for these four systems were determined. The lighter boron isotope (10B) is concentrated in the aqueous phase in the systems containing tetraﬂ uoroboric acid, whereas in the systems with boric acid it is concentrated in the organic phase.

Context: Vigorous progress of such ﬁ elds as nuclear power engineering, medicine, and instrument making makes it necessary to develop and produce specialty materials enriched in certain isotopes of various chemical elements. In particular, the boron isotope 10В, which has high cross section of thermal neutron capture, is a valuable constituent of many materials. For example, materials based on 10B are demanded in nuclear power engineering, namely, in reactor control and protection systems and in production of steel for transportation racks and containers for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Boron-10 is used in neutron capture therapy for cancer treatment. High demand for materials enriched in 10B and insuﬃ cient scale of their production make it topical to search for, study, and develop more eﬃ cient and environmentally safe procedures for boron isotope separation. Methods based on chemical isotope exchange, when isotope eﬀ ects inﬂ uence the properties of complexes of the extractive compound and extractant, are candidate separation methods. The “anisole process” is the most known and eﬃ cient among such methods. It is based on the reaction of gaseous BF3 with anisole CH3ОC6H5 to form the complex CH3ОC6H5∙BF3(l). This complex

Context: isotope composition were prepared by dilution of the initial solutions of boron-containing components (boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids) to a boron concentration of 1–5 mg/L. In the case of tetraﬂ uoroboric acid, it was subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of CaCl2 to remove ﬂ uoride ions interfering with the analysis. As organic diluent for the extractants we chose o-xylene, because this diluent prevents the third phase formation in extraction systems and favors fast phase separation, in contrast to aliphatic diluents such as dodecane. Prior to use, o-xylene was washed four times with equivalent amounts of distilled water. Chemically pure grade boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids were used without additional puriﬁ cation. Tartaric acid was recrystallized from water and dried; the melting point after the puriﬁ cation was 167°С. Tributyl phosphate was puriﬁ ed as described in [7].

Context: We determined the distribution ratios for each extraction system. The highest distribution ratio D is reached in the HBF4–TAPO system: 1.5 at low acid concentrations. High distribution ratio D is an advantage in commercial separation of boron isotopes, because at one extraction step the larger fraction of the substance is extracted, and thus the amount of the enriched product obtained increases.

Context:  Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly inﬂ uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetraﬂ uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances. Boric acid as a weak acid cannot be eﬃ ciently extracted into the organic phase without additional complexation; therefore, tartaric acid is added to aqueous boric acid solutions. Tartaric acid converts boric acid into a complex that is a stronger acid interacting with the extractant more eﬃ ciently. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid does not require such additives. It is interesting to consider organophosphorus compounds as extractants. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is one of the most readily available and widely used commercial extractants. Along with TBP, mixed trialkylphosphine oxide Cyanex 923 is used for the recovery of metal ions. Despite their wide use for the extraction of metal cations, there are few data on extraction of boron-containing acids with them. Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) were studied as extractants for acids structurally similar to HBF4, i.e., for monobasic complex metal-containing acids HMHal4, where М is a metal and Hal is a halogen. The data presented in review [5] show that compounds of metals in oxidation state (III) (such as Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III)) are extracted in the organic phase to form ion pairs consisting of solvated proton and metal-containing anion. HBF4 can be assumed to be extracted by OPCs by a similar mechanism. Mishra et al. [6] report the results of the extraction of HFeCl4 with tributyl phosphate (D = 3–8) and mixed trialkylphosphine oxides Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 (D = 2–8). Khoroshilov and Ivanov [4] studied the boric acid– TBP extraction system in the context of separation of boron isotopes. They obtained the single-stage isotope separation factor α = 1.0067 ± 0.0035 at 20–22°С. In this system, 10В was concentrated in the organic phase.

Context:  Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly inﬂ uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetraﬂ uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances. Boric acid as a weak acid cannot be eﬃ ciently extracted into the organic phase without additional complexation; therefore, tartaric acid is added to aqueous boric acid solutions. Tartaric acid converts boric acid into a complex that is a stronger acid interacting with the extractant more eﬃ ciently. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid does not require such additives. It is interesting to consider organophosphorus compounds as extractants. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is one of the most readily available and widely used commercial extractants. Along with TBP, mixed trialkylphosphine oxide Cyanex 923 is used for the recovery of metal ions. Despite their wide use for the extraction of metal cations, there are few data on extraction of boron-containing acids with them. Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) were studied as extractants for acids structurally similar to HBF4, i.e., for monobasic complex metal-containing acids HMHal4, where М is a metal and Hal is a halogen. The data presented in review [5] show that compounds of metals in oxidation state (III) (such as Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III)) are extracted in the organic phase to form ion pairs consisting of solvated proton and metal-containing anion. HBF4 can be assumed to be extracted by OPCs by a similar mechanism. Mishra et al. [6] report the results of the extraction of HFeCl4 with tributyl phosphate (D = 3–8) and mixed trialkylphosphine oxides Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 (D = 2–8). Khoroshilov and Ivanov [4] studied the boric acid– TBP extraction system in the context of separation of boron isotopes.

As we found, in the extraction of HBF4, 10B is accumulated in the aqueous phase in contrast to the systems with H3BO3, in which 10B is concentrated in the organic phase.

Context:  The synthesis and study of the properties of superheavy elements (SHE) is one of the fundamental areas of modern nuclear physics. Research in this area is being actively carried out both in Russia and in nuclear centers of other countries (Germany, Japan, USA). Thanks to the work performed at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (Dubna) and RIAR, nuclear- physical properties of new elements with serial numbers 115, 116, and 118 were synthesized and examined. These nuclides were prepared by irradiating targets based on highly enriched isotopes 243Am, 248Cm and 249Cf with 48Ca ions.

Context: of impurities, including Cf and Pu isotopes, ﬁ ssion products, and corrosion products of construction substances (stainless steel), remain in the materials after standard puriﬁ cation methods. For preparing materials of pure transplutonium ele- ments (TPE), ion exchange is widely used in radiochem- ical practice. In ion exchange chromatography, the sepa- ration is based on the selectivity of the ion exchange resin with respect to the counterions of the mixture. When separating ions with very similar properties [for example, rare earth elements (REE)], most ion exchange resins exhibit almost the same aﬃ nity relative to ions close to each other. Separation of rare-earth elements by elution from a column containing a cation exchange resin with a solution of a strong, non-chelating acid is practically impossible, since their distribution coeﬃ - cients diﬀ er little from each other [4]. If you choose a chelating agent that, with the ions of the mixture gives complex compounds of various strengths, then success- ful separation of the ions becomes possible. The stron- ger the complex formed in solution by the counterion, the less this ion will be absorbed by the ion exchange resin. Thus, the separation completeness of the mixture

Context:  components can be enhanced. The chelating reagent α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (α-HIBA) and its salts (main- ly ammonium) are used in ion-exchange processes of intra- and intergroup separation of REE and TPE radio- nuclides of [5–17]. Cation exchange methods are used to separate REE and TPE radionuclides by elution with solutions containing α-HIBA and its salts. Strongly acidic styrene–divinylbenzene sulfonic cation exchange resins, such as Dowex 50W-X8, Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8, and a number of their other analogues, are utilized as sorbents [6, 10, 12–16]. As a rule, in the technique used [5, 6, 9–12], trivalent actinides are ﬁ rst adsorbed from a dilute (<0.5 M) HNO3 solution on a cation exchange + form, resin. Then the sorbent is converted into the NH4 and the actinides are eluted with a chelating reagent (α-HIBA). It was noted in [8, 14] that, without prelimi- nary conversion of the cation exchange resin to the am- monium form by eluating with an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, the released H+ ions have a strong inhibi- tory eﬀ ect on poorly sorbed elements, such as Cf. Anion exchange chromatography using a strongly basic anionite Bio-Rad AG X8 was chosen as a method for purifying Am, Cm from Pu impurities. According to the literature data, Pu(IV) sorption on strongly basic anion exchange resins is possible from nitric acid and hydrochloric acid media [18–20]. In nitric acid media, Pu(IV) can be sorbed starting from 1 M HNO3, 2– therewith the maximum concentration of the Pu(NO3)6 anion is reached at 7.7 M HNO3 [18]. Sorption of Pu on anion exchange resins is also possible from high concentration HCl solutions. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Pu(IV) increases monotonically with a rise in the HCl concentration and, starting from a 9 M concentration, exceeds 1 × 103 [19]. Under these conditions, Am(III) and Cm(III) are not retained by the sorbent. This work was aimed at developing regimes for the puriﬁ cation of Cm and Am from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as developing the regimes for the separation of Am and Cm and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by ion exchange chromatography.

An Aspect α-spectrometer with a semiconductor detector based on an ion-implanted Si single crystal coated with an opaque Al layer was used to measure the contribution of individual nuclides to the total α-activity. The activity of the α-emitting radionuclide 244Сm was measured with an ESBS-7x α-spectrometer. Sources for measurement were prepared by depositing an aliquot of the measured solution on a metal substrate, drying under a lamp, and calcining to remove the salt layer.

Context:  where V is the volume of the sorbent layer (1 c.v.); VAꞌ is the reduced retention volume of substance A, c.v.; VM is dead volume, c.v. The dead volume VM required to calculate the volume distribution ratio includes the free volume of the column and the volume of communications between the eluent injection point and the column. The free volume of the column is taken to be 0.38 c.v., based on the data of [24] for the Dowex 50-X8 cation exchange resin (200–400 mesh). The volume of communications between the eluent injection point and the column was determined experimentally and was equal to 0.05 c.v. Thus, the dead volume of the VM is 0.43 c.v. The values of dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeﬃ cients are listed in Table 3.

Context:  The results in Tables 1–4 show that with an increase in the α-HIBA concentration at the second stage of the stepwise elution process, the width of the chromato- graphic peak at the base diminishes and the number of theoretical plates rises, i.e., peak blurring is reduced. At the same time, the selectivity α and the resolution RS de- crease, i.e., the overlapping degree of chromatographic peaks increases. It was noted in [25] that two substances will be separated if the selectivity α > 1; for a satisfac- tory separation, RS must be equal to 1. The separation is considered complete if RS is equal to or greater than 1.5. Therefore, the Cm and Am separation, as well as their puriﬁ cation from Eu and Cf, is recommended to be carried out by stepwise elution with 0.1 M (pH 5.0) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the ﬁ rst and second stage, respectively.

The radiometric methods used in this work show no Pu isotopes in the initial solution (the Pu content is below the detection limits), so the preliminary Pu separation on an anion exchange resin was not performed. A mixture of 248Cm, 241Am, and 249Cf radionuclides was separated on a column containing 10 cm3 of strongly acid Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange + form. The geometrical resin (200–400 mesh) in the NH4 parameters of the column are similar to the parameters

Context:  of the columns used when working with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am. The order of elution and the concentrations of α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions are similar to those used in experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am (Fig. 3). The content of 248Cm and 241Am and their distribution by fractions are shown in the output elution curves (Fig. 4). On the output elution curve of 248Cm (Fig. 4), the leading edge is more diﬀ use than in experiments with indicator amounts of this element (Fig. 3). Based on the data in [10], this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the distribution coeﬃ cient of Cm probably increases with a rise in its concentration. The relation- ship between the amount of a substance sorbed from the liquid phase and its concentration in this phase at a con- stant temperature is expressed by the sorption isotherm.

Context: Fig. 4. Output curves of elution of weight amounts of 248Cm (248Cm 26.6 mg, 241Am 3.3 × 106 Bq, 249Cf 3.6 × 105 Bq) with α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, pH 5.0. At low concentrations, the amount of sorbed substance is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase, and a linear sorption isotherm is observed (the distribu- tion coeﬃ cient does not depend on the concentration of the substance in the liquid phase). Each component of the zone moves at a constant rate, since the linear rate of its migration depends on the ﬂ ow rate of the mobile phase, which is set constant. The entire zone moves with the same rate, remaining symmetrical: the concentration of the component is maximum in the center of the zone and decreases symmetrically towards the edges. There- fore, the peak on the chromatogram is also symmetrical (Figs. 1–3). If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeﬃ cient is greater than for low concentra- tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra- tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm). As a result, the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred and the peak is asymmetric. Since the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred when Am and Cf are removed from Am and Cf (Fig. 4), it can be assumed that the Cm sorption isotherm has a concave character. For a concave isotherm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diﬀ use leading edge; the retained volume increases with increasing ion concentration. For the speciﬁ ed Cm weight, the following charac- teristics were experimentally determined: the retention volume V = 35.4 c.v., the width of the chromatographic peak at the base W = 6.1 c.v., the dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeﬃ cient D = 35, the number of theoreti- cal plates N = 539. Comparison with the experimental results with indicator amounts of 244Cm (Table 2) shows that the number of theoretical plates N decreased when purifying the weight amounts of Cm. The result ob- tained agrees with the data of [9], in which the eluative separation of Am and Cm on a sulfonic cation exchange resin with α-HIBA was studied. It was shown in [9] that with an increase in the initial loading of the column with the mixture to be separated, the chromatographic sepa- ration eﬃ ciency of Am and Cm decreases (the number N of theoretical plates decreases). Using the developed technology, for the ﬁ rst time at RIAR, a 248Cm radionuclide material with a radionuclide and chemical purity signiﬁ cantly exceeding the indicators of preparations obtained using standard technology was produced [1–3]. The characteristics of the 248Cm preparation are as follows: the content of ﬁ ssion products (an activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

Context: The regimes of Cm and Am puriﬁ cation from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as the Am and Cm separation re- gimes and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by ion ex- change chromatography were determined. It was estab- lished that the separation of Pu microamounts from Am and Cm can be carried out by its sorption on a strongly basic Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (50– 100 mesh) from 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2. The Am and Cm separation and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by cation exchange chromatography with the α-HIBA ammonium salt solution as an eluent were tested. The REE and TPE separation is carried out in the regime of stepwise elution with the α-HIBA ammonium salt so- lutions of 0.1 (pH 5.0) (ﬁ rst stage) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) (second stage) concentrations. At the ﬁ rst stage of the process, Cf is recovered; at the second stage, Eu, Cm, and Am are separated. In experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am, the characteristics of the chromatographic process of cation exchange puriﬁ cation were determined: the number of theoretical plates N, distribution coeﬃ cient D, selectivity (separation factor) α, resolution RS. It was noted that upon puriﬁ cation of weight amounts of Cm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diﬀ use leading edge, i.e., the concentration Cm corresponds to the nonlinear section of the sorption isotherm. With a nonlinear sorption isotherm, the blurring of chromatographic zones increases and the eﬃ ciency of the chromatographic column diminishes (the number of theoretical plates N decreases and the resolution of the Am and Cm peaks decreases), resulting in reducing the separation completeness of these elements Puriﬁ cation of weight quantities of 248Cm was carried out, and the 248Cm preparation was produced with the fol- lowing characteristics: the content of ﬁ ssion products (the activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤ 2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

Context:  There are at least three criteria in choosing the ra- dioactive isotope for in vivo and in vitro tracer studies. The radiation should be easy detectable; the half-life of the radioisotope should be neither too short nor too long; and the cost of the radioisotope should be moder- ate [1]. Lead-203 has a very simple decay mode (Fig. 1). It decays by electron capture followed by emission of γ-rays with energies of 279 (81%), 401 (5%), and 680 keV (0.9%). 203Pb with a half-life of 52 h is poten- tially useful for clinical scanning. High specific activ- ity and radiochemical purity of 203Pb are important for radiolabeling. 1–5 mCi of 203Pb radioisotope contains a trace amount of lead, which is less than 0.1% of the normal daily lead intake [2]. There are a number of methods for the 203Pb production [2–5]. Lead-203 is produced from either mercury or thal- lium target. Natural mercury has six stable isotopes. Several radionuclides of lead and thallium can be pro- duced by bombardment of natural mercury with 3He or 4He particles. Separation of 203Pb using this method is very difficult. The use of enriched mercury as a target material could partially solve this problem, but the cost of the obtained 203Pb will be very high. Therefore, the preferred target material for the production of 203Pb is

Context: Materials and equipment. Thallium(I) sulfate (99.9%) was purchased from UCB (Union Chimique Belge). Lead nitrate was purchased from Fluka. Stan- dard 1000 mg L−1 solutions of lead and thallium were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. All the other chemi- cals were purchased from Merck. Cu backings were produced in our workshop. All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade and were used without fur- ther purification. Working solutions of Pb and Tl were prepared by diluting appropriate amounts of the stock solutions. A Hydro Ultrapure water purification system was used for making deionized water needed to prepare all the required solutions. An HPGe detector system (CanberraTM, GC1020-7500SL) in conjugation with a PC-based MCA and A Metrohm 827 pH meter was used. Target preparation. Natural thallium(I) sulfate (Tl2SO4), was chosen as the target material. High- quality thallium targets (70 μm) were prepared by elec- trodeposition of 1 g of Tl on 12 cm2 copper backings. The first plating bath is prepared by dissolving a por- tion of natTl2SO4 in an aqueous alkaline solution con- taining EDTA as a complexing agent, hydrazine hy- drate as an anodic depolarizer, and Brij-35 as a wetting agent. Constant-current electrolysis was carried out by applying a bipolar chopped saw-tooth voltage between the Pt anode and copper cathode. Target irradiation. The proton-induced nuclear reaction cross section data are very important for the production of medical radioisotopes using cyclo- trons. The excitation functions of 203Tl(p,2n)202Pb, 205Tl(p,2n)204Pb, 203Tl(p,4n)200Pb, 203Tl(p,3n)201Pb, 205Tl(p,3n)203Pb, and 205Tl(p,4n)202Pb reactions have been reported in the literature [15–19].

In the course of elu- tion, 203Pb is washed out from the column, and the other nuclides remain adsorbed. The collected solution was heated to remove HCl, and the residue was dis- solved in normal saline solution. Solvent extraction. Another part of B was dis- solved in 8 M HCl. Iron was extracted with diisopropyl ether (DIPE), the aqueous phase was heated to evapo- rate the HCl, and the residue was dissolved in normal saline (0.9% w/v NaCl). Solid phase extraction with nanomagnetic ion- imprinted polymer. The magnetic nanoparticles were prepared according to [20]. Briefly, to 20 mL of a 2 M FeCl3 solution in an Erlenmeyer flask, 13.3 mL of 1 M sodium sulfite was added dropwise under sonication over the course of 1 min. This solution was transferred to 250 mL of 0.85 M aqueous ammonia with vigorous stirring. The solution color turned from orange to black immediately. Then, 500 mL of deionized water was added to the mixture, and the mixture was heated at 90°C for 2 h with stirring in an air flow. To prepare Pb-imprinted amino-functionalized sor- bent based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), 1.5 g of Pb(NO3)2 was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol with stir- ring and heating, and 5 mL of 3-aminopropyltri- ethoxysilane (APS) was added to the mixture. The so- lution was stirred and refluxed for 2 h. After that, 10 mL of glycerol and 30 mL of deionized water were added. Then, a portion of the suspension of MNPs in water was added. After stirring for 24 h and at 90°C, the sorbent was collected with a power magnet. Amino-functionalized MNPs were washed four times, each time with 25 mL of ethanol and 25 mL of 0.02 M NaCl.

Context: After at least 37 h to ensure the decay of most of 201Pb (T1/2 = 9.33 h) to 201Tl, about 5 mg of FeCl3 was added to a part of the nitrate solution (solution A) for precipitating 203Pb. Then, the solution was alkalized to pH 12 with ammonium hydroxide. 203Pb is coprecipi- tated with ferric hydroxide. To separate trace amounts of thallium that can be adsorbed, the precipitate was dissolved in the same way, and washed with aqueous ammonia. Finally, excess ammonia was removed by heating. The residue was stored with tag B.

Context:  The total amount of 203Pb before and after separa- tion was determined in all cases by the region of inter- est (ROI) values. The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods. The irradiation yield is 2.2 mCi μA–1 h–1.

Context: Abstract—A method has been developed for isolation of 228Ac from aged samples of natural 232Th. Macroscopic amounts of the thorium bulk (20 g) were separated by its extraction by a solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions, with microamounts of 228Ra and 228Ac remaining in the aqueous phase. 228Ac was selectively extracted from the resulting solution by the method of extraction chromatography on a col- umn with RE resin sorbent, and 228Ra quantitatively remained in the 4 M HNO3 eluate. 228Ac was washed out of the column with 0.05 M HNO3, it could be used as a radioisotope for research purposes. After the accumulation of the daughter 228Ac the solution of 228Ra in 4 M HNO3 was repeatedly passed through an identical column. The resulting 228Ac was used in the study to examine its sorption on commercial and modiﬁ ed carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) instead of the diﬃ cultly accessible 225Ac. It is shown that the application of CNMs as carriers of actinium isotopes for nuclear medicine purposes is promising.

Context: The targeted alpha-therapy in nuclear medicine frequently uses the 225Ac that undergoes the fast alpha- decays [1–3]. This isotope is obtained by diﬀ erent methods, including that in which thorium targets are irradiated with high-energy protons. However, this method does not ﬁ nd wide application because the number of suitable accelerators in the world is exceedingly small, which gives rise to problems with the availability of the given isotope [4]. In addition, 225Ac is not quite convenient for pre-clinical trials because of emitting gamma photons in low yield (not more tham 1% at 100 keV). At the same time, the gamma-emitting isotope 228Ac (T1/2 = 6.1 h) is present in the radioactive decay series of natural thorium as a product formed in the decay of a mother isotope 228Ra and can be isolated in the radiochemically pure form.

Context: The targeted alpha-therapy in nuclear medicine frequently uses the 225Ac that undergoes the fast alpha- decays [1–3]. This isotope is obtained by diﬀ erent methods, including that in which thorium targets are irradiated with high-energy protons. However, this method does not ﬁ nd wide application because the number of suitable accelerators in the world is exceedingly small, which gives rise to problems with the availability of the given isotope [4]. In addition, 225Ac is not quite convenient for pre-clinical trials because of emitting gamma photons in low yield (not more tham 1% at 100 keV). At the same time, the gamma-emitting isotope 228Ac (T1/2 = 6.1 h) is present in the radioactive decay series of natural thorium as a product formed in the decay of a mother isotope 228Ra and can be isolated in the radiochemically pure form.

Therefore, with 228Ra isolated from gram amounts of thorium nitrate, 228Ac can be dayly extracted from the generator with activity suﬃ cient for carrying out studies, including those performed in vivo (several and tens of kBq). Various ways to separate Th, Ra, and Ac are known from the literature [4–10]. 228Ra and 232Th are, as a rule, separated via coprecipitation of radium and its extraction in various systems [4, 5]. Actinium and radium are separated by ion-exchange chromatography [6, 7], extraction [8], selective sorption [9], and extraction chromatography [4, 6,10]. In these studies, small amounts of 232Th or trace amounts of 229Th have been used. At the same time, there is no published information about isolation of 228Ac from large amounts of 232Th (tens of grams).

Context: The puriﬁ ed 228Ac preparation was obtained in several stages. In the ﬁ rst stage, macroamounts 232Th and accumulated 228Th are separated from a mixture of their decay products (Fig. 1) via extraction of thorium by a 1 : 1 solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions. The choce of the extraction agent was governed by earlier studies [4] in which it was found that the best reagent among those examined for separation of 232Th from products formed in its irradiation by high-energy protons (and also of radium and actinium) is HDEHP, which extracts 232Th from nitrate solutions in a wide range of HNO3 concentrations [25–27]. The phases were vigorously agitated for 5 min, centrifuged, and then separated in a separating funnel. The extraction was performed three times, and the aqueous solution with 228Ra was passed, to be fuller puriﬁ ed to remove thorium, through a column with extraction-chromatographic sorbent LN (Triskem Int., France, based on HDEHP, particles size 100–150 mesh). The sorbent ﬁ rmly retains thorium in a wide range of HNO3 concentrations, with radium and actinium not retained by this sorbent at HNO3 concentrations exceeding 0.2 M [28]. The mixture of nuclides, remaining after the separation of thorium isotopes contains 228Ra (in which 228Ac accumulates) and also 224Ra (in equilibrium with other decay products, including gaseous 220Rn) and the stable 208Pb. A single-stage isolation of 228Ac from a mixture of this kind is a complicated task, and deep puriﬁ cation to remove 224Ra is necessary for obtaining the radiochemically pure 228Ac.

Context:  mixture was kept for one month till the complete decay of 224Ra. In the ﬁ nal stage, 228Ac was separated from 228Ra, 208Pb, and newly formed 228Th. For this purpose, a solution of 228Ra in HNO3 was evaporated to dryness in a glass ﬂ ask on an electric hot plate, dissolved in 4 M HNO3; and the solution was placed in a column with RE extraction-chromatographic sorbent (Triskem Int., France, based on carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide and tributyl phosphate) with volume of 2 mL. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by selective elution from the column: ﬁ rst, 228Ra was eluted with a 4 M HNO3 solution, and then 228Ac, in 0.05 M HNO3, with fractions collected each having a volume of 1 mL The purity of 228Ac was determined by registering its gamma- spectrum during three days. To perform experiments on sorption of actinium on CNMs, the 228Ac eluate in 0.05 M HNO3 was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in several mL of a phosphate buﬀ ered saline (PBS) with pH 7. Gamma-spectrometry. The content of thorium, radium, and actinium, in the samples was found by the gamma-spectrometry on a spectrometer equipped with a GR 3818 high-purity germanium detector (Canberra Industries, United States). Thorium was identiﬁ ed by the gamma-peak of 228Th with energy of 84.4 keV. The content of 228Ra was determined by using the additionally introduced gamma-emitting 226Ra (186 keV, 3.6%) obtained via dissolution of 226RaBr2 in 0.01 M HCl. 228Ac was determined from the lines at 338 (11.3%) and 911 (25.8%) keV. Characterization of CNMs. We used in the study the following commercial samples of CNMs: powdered detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) of UDA-TAN brand (Federal State Unitary Enterprise SKTB Tekhnolog, Russia), aqueous suspension of partly reuced graphite oxide (GO), and powdered multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Nanotekhtsentr OOO, Tambov, Russia). The morphology of CNM particles was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on a JEM-2100F/Cs/GIF instrument (JEOL, Japan). The speciﬁ c surface of the CNMs was determined by the method of thermal desorption of nitrogen in terms of the BET model. The content of impurity elements in the CNMs was found by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP- MS) (X Series 2, Thermo Scientiﬁ c, United States). The elemental composition of the CNM surface was determined by the method of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical, Great Britain). The hydrodynamic diameter of CNM particles in hydrosols was determined by the method of dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Red Badge, 633 nm) ZEN 3600 analyzer (Malvern Instruments, United States). Acid functional groups on the CNM surface were determined by potentiometric titration. The surface of the CNM samples was modiﬁ ed by the procedures described in [29, 30]. DNDs were oxidized in a 3 : 1 mixture H2SO4/HNO3 at 120°C for 24 h, and GO and MWCNTs were hydrogenated in the Ar + 10% H2 atmosphere at 800°C for 5 h. Study of the sorption behavior of 228Ac on CNM. In a study of the sorption of Ac(III) on CNMs, a 100-μL portion of a CNM suspension was placed in polypropylene test tubes with a cover, and 900 μL of the resulting solution of 228Ac was added. The test tubes were shaken on a TS-100 shaker (Biosan, Latvia), and after that the mixture was centrifuged on a CM-50 centrifuge (Eppendorf, United States) for 20 min at 18000 g. Then, the gamma-spectrum of the 228Ac solution was recorded, and the counting rate of an aliquot of the solution was compared with that for a reference sample. To determine the amount of desorption, to the solution and precipitate remaining in the test tube was added a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, with the content of BSA in the resulting solution being 40 g/L. The contents of the test tube were stirred up and placed on a shaker, after which the phases were separated by centrifuging for subsequent radiometric measurements.

Context:  Fig. 2. Extractive-chromatographic separation of 228Ra and 228Ac on RE sorbent in HNO3. Column volume 2 mL, diameter 0.7 cm. Fig. 3. Kinetics of Ac(III) sorption on CNM in PBS at 25°C, m/V ratio 100 μg/mL. found here that the yield of 228Ac is nearly quantitative (not less than 95% relative to the amount placed on the column), with the separation factor of 228Ra and 228Ac being 2.2 × 104. According to [31], 208Pb is eluted from the column together with 228Ra. Thus, we developed a method for separation 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state from large amounts of natural thorium. The isolated 228Ac can be used in scientiﬁ c studies, including in vivo experiments. It was found that, with the developed method implemented, the loss of 228Ra does not exceed 0.005% of the amount placed in the column. Therefore, the starting 228Ra preparation can be repeatedly used. For this purpose, the fractions from 1 to 9 mL were evaporated and again dissolved in 1 mL of 4 M HNO3. It was shown that the results are reproducible because 228Ac could be eluted from the generator we developed not less than 20 times. In a prolonged use of the solution of 228Ra, there occurs accumulation of 228Th occurs due to the decay of 228Ac, but 228Th is quantitatively sorbed on the column with RE in the process of separation of 228Ra and 228Ac [31]. It is supposed that the columns with the sorbent are intended for single use, and, therefore, 228Th does not contaminate the solution of 228Ac being prepared. In the many-years use of the generator, the extract of 232Th can be repeatedly used to extract 228Ra accumulated in it.

Kinetics of Ac(III) sorption on CNM in PBS at 25°C, m/V ratio 100 μg/mL. found here that the yield of 228Ac is nearly quantitative (not less than 95% relative to the amount placed on the column), with the separation factor of 228Ra and 228Ac being 2.2 × 104. According to [31], 208Pb is eluted from the column together with 228Ra. Thus, we developed a method for separation 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state from large amounts of natural thorium. The isolated 228Ac can be used in scientiﬁ c studies, including in vivo experiments. It was found that, with the developed method implemented, the loss of 228Ra does not exceed 0.005% of the amount placed in the column. Therefore, the starting 228Ra preparation can be repeatedly used. For this purpose, the fractions from 1 to 9 mL were evaporated and again dissolved in 1 mL of 4 M HNO3. It was shown that the results are reproducible because 228Ac could be eluted from the generator we developed not less than 20 times. In a prolonged use of the solution of 228Ra, there occurs accumulation of 228Th occurs due to the decay of 228Ac, but 228Th is quantitatively sorbed on the column with RE in the process of separation of 228Ra and 228Ac [31]. It is supposed that the columns with the sorbent are intended for single use, and, therefore, 228Th does not contaminate the solution of 228Ac being prepared. In the many-years use of the generator, the extract of 232Th can be repeatedly used to extract 228Ra accumulated in it.

Context: and in composition. For example, DNDs are constituted by spherical particles, GO, by planar nanoparticles, and CNTs have micrometer threadlike structure with a internal hollow. Also the CNT samples had diﬀ erent speciﬁ c surface areas which were 240, 700, and 160 m2/g for DNDs, GO, and CNTs, respectively. It was found that, among the CNMs under study, DNDs have the smallest amount of impurities (up to 1.4 mg/g). It was shown that modiﬁ cation of samples in their oxidation and hydrogenation led to a change in the surface composition of CNMs according to the results of XPS and potentiometric titration. For example, the oxidation of a DND sample resulted in that the number of carboxy groups became 3 times larger (from 330 to 990 μmol/g). Study of 228Ac sorption onto CNMs. The kinetics of 228Ac sorption on various CNM samples in PBS was examined (Fig. 3). It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the sorption equilibrium is reached in 30 min for all the CNM samples for all studied CNMs. The sorption in 60 min was nearly quantitative (not less than 95% for DND, GO, and CNT samples, the limiting amount of sorption being about 60% for all the CNM samples. It was found the decrease between the CNM mass and the solution volume from 100 to 10 μg/mL does not lead to a change in the amount of sorption. This will make it possible to substantially reduce the mass of the in vivo introduced conjugate Ac(III)@CNM. It was shown by a study of the desorption of 228Ac from samples of commercial CNMs in a solution of BSA in BP that up to 30–40% of actinium is desorbed in 30 min, after which the amount of desorption does not change signiﬁ cantly during 150 min (Fig. 4).

Context:  disappearance of its physical component, but positively aﬀ ects the strength of binding between the conjugate and actinium in a solution of BSA in PBS. Interpretation of changes of this kind is diﬃ cult for GO and GO-H, and a further study of the 228Ac sorption mechanism on these samples is necessary. As for the interaction of 228Ac with CNTs, two mechanisms are probably operative in the sorption: sorption of ions within the tube hollows, as shown previously in [32], and the physical sorption on impurity metals (Table 1) contained at tube ends. In the hydrogenation, of CNTs, the catalyst is removed, which can account for the decrease in the total amount of sorption and the increase in the stability against desorption. To conclude, it can be noted that all the CNMs are promising for application in nuclear medicine as a carrier for actinium. In the case of limited amounts of radioactive isotopes of actinium, it is appropriate to use DNDs, GO, and CNTs for which the sorption is nearly quantitative, whereas DND-COOH, GO-H, and CNT-H are the most suitable for in vivo studies, For these the amount of desorption in 3 h does not exceed 5% in solutions of a model biological medium, whereas for the commercial CNMs under study it is about of 40%.

Context:  Atorvastatin is a representative of lipid-lowering drug family recognized as statins. It acts selectively in the liver as inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and cho- lesterol synthesis. It is chemically described as (3R,5R)- 7-[2-(4-ﬂ uorophenyl)-3-phenyl-4-(phenylcarbamoyl)- 5-propan-2-ylpyrrol-1-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acid [1]. The lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the radiolabeled complexes determines the binding aﬃ nity for hepatic transport proteins, the eﬃ ciency of their hepatocyte up- take, and the excretion pathways [2, 3]. Atorvastatin is taken up selectively into the liver (hepatocytes) via organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) [4, 5], excreted into the biliary system, and stored by the gallbladder [6, 7]. Atorvastatin is a lipophilic statin but is relatively hydrophilic compared to simvastatin and lovastatin, which makes it more hepatoselective and able to cross cellular membrane either by passive diﬀ usion and/or active carrier-mediated process [8, 9]. The liver-selective uptake and the tissue- speciﬁ c distribution of atorvastatin via organic anion transporters ensure high pharmacological eﬀ ect. In the liver, the statin drug undergoes Cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism [10–13]. The dominant active

Context: metabolites are 2-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid [14, 15]. Elimination of atorvastatin occurs from the systemic circulation through the liver via the bile into the feces and through the kidneys via the renal- urinary system [16–19]. Most of the hepatobiliary radiopharmaceuticals available for imaging are labeled with 99mTc. They exhibit identical pharmacokinetic properties in animals. They are eﬃ ciently removed from the blood by the liver and excreted into the bile. Moreover, they diagnose diseases of hepatocytic function and the functional status of the cystic duct and the gallbladder [6]. The mechanism of in situ oxidative radioiodination using chloramine-T (CAT), involving the formation of iodine monochloride (ICl), was elucidated [20, 21]. In weakly acidic media, CAT dissociates to ArSO2NCl– anion, which may react directly with iodide to form ICl. Subsequently the iodine monochloride (ICl) reacts with any position in the target molecule that can experience electrophilic substitution [20, 22]. Owing to the diﬀ erence in the electronegativity between iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and acts as a source of iodonium ion (I+). Therefore, aromatic electrophilic labeling with electropositive radioiodide usually proceeds in high radiochemical yield compared to 50% yield if molecular

Context:  iodine is used, because ICl is a stronger iodinating agent than I2 [23, 24]. The electrophilic iodination method is applied to various types of receptors and ligands as long as those ligands have a site where the substitution can occur and are stable under the oxidizing conditions at pH of the reaction. Synthetic routes to radioiodinated compounds are usually more diﬃ cult compared to other halogen- containing radiopharmaceuticals because iodine is the largest, the least electronegative, and the most polarizable of the halogens and forms the weakest C–X bond [25, 26]. Elemental iodine is weakly reactive, requiring an activator for eﬃ cient introduction into organic compounds [27]. On the other hand, iodonium ion (I+), which acts as an electrophile for the radioiodination process, can be generated in situ in the presence of CAT as a convenient oxidizer, thus enabling the eﬃ cient and selective direct iodination of atorvastatin under ambient conditions [28, 29]. This work describes the development of a simple and eﬃ cient procedure for the radioiodination of atorvastatin under ambient conditions using CAT and characterization and evaluation of the biological behavior of 125I-atorvastatin as a promising selective radiopharmaceutical for targeting hepatobiliary system for liver imaging.

On the other hand, iodonium ion (I+), which acts as an electrophile for the radioiodination process, can be generated in situ in the presence of CAT as a convenient oxidizer, thus enabling the eﬃ cient and selective direct iodination of atorvastatin under ambient conditions [28, 29]. This work describes the development of a simple and eﬃ cient procedure for the radioiodination of atorvastatin under ambient conditions using CAT and characterization and evaluation of the biological behavior of 125I-atorvastatin as a promising selective radiopharmaceutical for targeting hepatobiliary system for liver imaging.

Context:  iodine is used, because ICl is a stronger iodinating agent than I2 [23, 24]. The electrophilic iodination method is applied to various types of receptors and ligands as long as those ligands have a site where the substitution can occur and are stable under the oxidizing conditions at pH of the reaction.

Context: and HPLC. The inﬂ uence of the CAT concentration (3–75 mM), atorvastatin amount (25–200 μg), pH of the reaction mixture (3–11), and the reaction time (5–60 min) on the radiochemical yield was examined. The conditions were optimized in order to enhance the labeling yield. Radiochemical analysis. The radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin was determined by silica gel thin-layer chromatography (SG-TLC). Samples were spotted 2 cm above the lower edge of the strip (1 cm width, 13 cm length). TLCs were developed in a benzene : ethyl acetate mixture (7 : 3 v/v). The radiochemical yield was expressed as the percent ratio of the radioactivity of 125I-atorvastatin to the total radioactivity. The radiochemical yield was the mean value of three experiments. Puriﬁ cation and chromatographic analysis of the radioiodinated complex were performed on Agilent HPLC system coupled to a sodium iodide radiometric detector. A 10-μL aliquot of 125I-atorvastatin solution at the optimum conditions was injected into a reversed-phase C18 column (Waters, 150 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm) kept at 25°C and was eluted with a mobile phase that contained 0.05 M CH3COONa buﬀ er and CH3CN (40 : 60, v/v) and was adjusted to pH 4.0. Atorvastatin was detected by UV absorbance at 246 nm. The mobile phase was ﬁ ltered and degassed before use and was pumped at a ﬂ ow rate of 1.00 mL/min [30]. In vitro stability. The in vitro stability of the complex was evaluated by incubating 1 mL of the reaction mixture at 37°C for 24 h. Exact 2–30 μL aliquots were extracted and analyzed at various time intervals using TLC and HPLC to determine the percent content of 125I-atorvastatin. Lipophilicity (partition coeﬃ cient log P). The lipophilicity of 125I-atorvastatin was measured experimentally by adding 5 mL of n-octanol and PBS (50 : 50) to a centrifuge tube containing a 1 mL aliquot of the radioiodinated compound. The tube was shaken for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min.

Context:  Synthesis of 125I-atorvastatin was carried out by direct electrophilic substitution with no-carrier-added 125I (T1/2 = 60 days) under oxidative conditions in the presence of CAT. The presumable reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The TLC results show that radioiodide stayed near the origin (Rf = 0–0.1), while 125I-atorvastatin proceeded with the solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1). The radiolabeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.4% (n = 5). It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the puriﬁ cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin. These products might be accumulated in non-target organs. As we found, 125I-atorvastatin was stable for up to 24 h.

Context:  Synthesis of 125I-atorvastatin was carried out by direct electrophilic substitution with no-carrier-added 125I (T1/2 = 60 days) under oxidative conditions in the presence of CAT. The presumable reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The TLC results show that radioiodide stayed near the origin (Rf = 0–0.1), while 125I-atorvastatin proceeded with the solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1). The radiolabeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.4% (n = 5). It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the puriﬁ cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin. These products might be accumulated in non-target organs. As we found, 125I-atorvastatin was stable for up to 24 h. The lipophilicity was determined by measuring the distribution of 125I-atorvastatin between n-octanol and

Context:  Fig. 4. (Color online) Radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin as a function of reaction time. suppressing the formation of electropositive iodine. Figure 4 shows how the 125I-atorvastatin yield depends on the reaction time in the range from 1 to 60 min. The labeling yield increased with time, reaching 94.3% in 30 min. An increase in the reaction time beyond 30 min led to a small decrease in the radiochemical yield due to side oxidative reactions, whereas shorter reaction time is apparently insuﬃ cient for CAT to fully react with iodide ions and generate the iodonium ions. water. The experimental log P of the labeled molecule (5.9 ± 0.3) was found to be higher than that of atorvastatin (5.4), which may be due to the attachment of iodine. Therefore, atorvastatin is eluted before radioiodinated atorvastatin on reversed-phase HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 1). The lipophilic characteristics of 125I-atorvastatin are important for predicting the uptake and excretion pathways, as hydrophobic radiopharmaceuticals are generally extracted via the hepatobiliary pathway (eﬃ ciently taken up from the blood by the liver, excreted into the bile, and stored by the gallbladder) and slightly via the renal route as it was demonstrated from the in vivo biodistribution studies.

Context: concentration. The radiochemical yield as a function of atorvastatin concentration is plotted in Fig. 2. With an increase in the amount of atorvastatin from 25 to 50 μg (0.45–0.9 mM), the radiochemical yield increased from 85 to 94.3 ± 1.4%. Further increase in the amount of atorvastatin beyond 50 μg had no eﬀ ect on the labeling yield; i.e., the amount of 50 μg is suﬃ cient to capture all the produced iodonium ions. Eﬀ ect of CAT concentration. The eﬀ ect of CAT concentration on the radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin is shown in Fig. 3. High radiochemical yield (94.3 ± 1.4%) was attained with an increase in the CAT concentration from 3 to 13 mM at pH 5 and 30 min reaction time. Further increase in the oxidizing agent concentration over 13 mM decreases the radioiodination yield due to the production of undesirable oxidation by- products as a result of denaturation and chlorination of atorvastatin exposed to high concentration of CAT for a relatively long time. Eﬀ ect of reaction time. Chloramine-T is a powerful oxidant, and it may cause oxidative damage of sensitive biological substrates or targets if overexposed.

Context: Table 1 summarizes the biodistribution data. The labeled atorvastatin showed immediate and dynamic clearance from the blood as the radioactivity detected in the blood was 5.51 ± 0.24 and 2.11 ± 0.08% at 0.5 and 4 h post injection, respectively. As expected from the lipophilicity of 125I-atorvastatin, the amount of radioactivity taken up by the liver was relatively high: 40.35 ± 0.59% at 1 h and 10.63 ± 0.36% ID/organ at 4 h p.i. The uptake in the intestines was 19.63 ± 0.76% at 0.5 h and increased to 25.21 ± 0.36% at 4 h p.i., suggesting the clearance via the hepatobiliary excretion pathway through the intestines. The radioiodinated compound showed low accumulation and retention in the kidneys (6.25 ± 0.32% at 0.5 h and 1.54% at 4 h p.i.). The collected activity in the urine was 12.31 ± 0.41% at 4 h post injection, suggesting a second clearance route via renal-urinary excretion system. Thus, 125I-atorvastatin cleared eﬀ ectively via the hepatobiliary (liver + intestines) excretion pathway and to a lesser extent through the renal-urinary system. Fig. 5. (Color online) Radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin as a function of pH. Eﬀ ect of pH. The eﬀ ect of pH on the radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin is shown in Fig. 5. The pH of the medium and the reaction conditions determine the nature of active oxidizing species produced. In acidic medium, chloramine-T undergoes hydrolysis to form hypochlorous acid, which, in turn, unergoes protonation to H2OCl+. Both HOCl and H2OCl+ are considered as the potential oxidizing species in acidiﬁ ed CAT solutions [20]. Both species can oxidize iodine under acidic conditions to iodonium (I+), which rapidly reacts with any sites within atorvastatin that can undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. In alkaline medium, CAT generates hypochlorite ion; it converts iodide to hypoiodite and iodiate ions, which are unfavorable species for the radioiodination [20].

Context:  The uptake in the lungs was small (1.42 ± 0.03%). The activity in the majority of organs decreased in the period between 0.5 and 4 h p.i., except for stomach and thyroid, where it increased with time. The increase in the thyroid radioactivity from 1.73 ± 0.03% at 0.5 h and 6.1 ± 0.3% at 4 h p.i. suggests the presence of free radioiodide, presumably due to the metabolism of the compound. The stomach and thyroid uptake shows that only a limited amount of radioiodine was released from the 125I-atorvastatin in vivo, conﬁ rming satisfactory in vivo stability and insigniﬁ cant biological decomposition due to metabolism. The in vivo stability complies with the high in vitro stability in human plasma. Predosing the mice with nonradioactive atorvastatin 0.5 h prior to the injection of labeled compound decreased the liver uptake to 19.25 ± 0.52% ID/organ. This result suggests that 125I-atorvastatin binds selectively to the liver and that the uptake was speciﬁ c. Similar radioiodinated compounds targeting liv- er such as m-iodobenzylguanidine labeled with 131I (131I-MIBG) show the uptake of 1.65% ID/g after 2 h [31]. Growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) labeled with 125I (125I-TGF-β1), targeting the liver, showed 2.4% ID/g [32].

Context: An eﬃ cient procedure was developed for selective radioiodination of atorvastatin via direct electrophilic substitution at ambient temperature in the presence of an appropriate oxidant, chloramine-T. The product showed good radiochemical stability and metabolic stability in vivo. The biodistribution studies carried out in mice expressed the aﬃ nity of 125I-atorvastatin for hepatic cells. 125I-labeled atorvastatin behaves as a lipophilic compound, is extracted by liver on hepatocytes, and is excreted into the bile duct and ﬁ nally into the intestine. The maximum liver uptake occurs approximately within 30 min after the injection. 125I-atorvastatin clears predominantly by the hepatobiliary pathway.

Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efﬁcient production of high speciﬁc activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efﬁciently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with speciﬁc activity up to 5.6 GBq/µmoL. It was further incorporated into modiﬁed monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: Academic Editor: Derek J. McPhee Received: 21 February 2017; Accepted: 11 April 2017; Published: 17 April 2017 Abstract: Copper-64 is a useful radioisotope for positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efﬁcient production of high speciﬁc activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efﬁciently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with speciﬁc activity up to 5.6 GBq/µmoL. It was further incorporated into modiﬁed monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context:  Copper-64 (64Cu) is an attractive radionuclide of considerable interest for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and radiotherapy due to its intrinsic physical and chemical properties. It has high spatial resolution comparable to 18F radionuclide, with comparable average free travel distance for their generated positrons (Rave.(β+) = 0.70 and 0.69 mm, respectively), due to their comparable positron energy (0.656 MeV and 0.635 MeV, respectively) [1,2]. It has a relatively long half-life of 12.7 h, compared with ﬂuorine-18 (t1/2 = 110 min) and carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min). In addition, 64Cu also emits β− and Auger electrons, enabling it to be useful for both PET imaging and radiotherapy. Moreover, the versatile coordination chemistry of 64Cu allows for its reaction with a wide variety of chelator systems, such as DOTA, NOTA, TETA and CB-TE2A, that can be linked to antibodies, peptides and nanoparticles [3]. The 64Cu radioisotope can be used for the design and synthesis of a wide range of radio-probes, providing attractive candidates for PET imaging.

Context: such as in head and neck cancer, and cardiac conditions [7,8]. More radiotracers are in clinical development [9–12], especially those with peptides and antibodies. For example, 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab was used to conduct PET imaging of HER2-positive lesions in patients with primary and metastatic breast cancer [13]. The PET image of 64Cu-DOTATATE provided superior image quality, and detected more lesions than 111In-DTPA-octreotide [14]. Grubmüller, B. et al. investigated the diagnostic potential of 64Cu-PSMA-617 in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma [15]. 64Cu has been produced at many centers [16–19]. Among the nuclear reactions examined, the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu method is the best and widely used, since high production yield of the 64Cu can be obtained with low energy protons in this route [20,21]. At Washington University, an effective method was investigated to produce high speciﬁc activity 64Cu on a small biomedical cyclotron using the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction, and 64Cu has been produced for more than 17 years by the irradiation of electroplated enriched 64Ni targets in this center [20,22]. The Turku PET Centre has been producing 64Cu since 2008 using 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu reaction, and also handles the irradiated target, radioactive liquids and gases using automated equipment [23,24]. At the University of Wisconsin, 64Cu and 61Co radionuclides have been simultaneously produced using the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction on a low energy proton-only cyclotron [25]. Ohya, T. et al. (2016) produced high-quality 64Cu for routine use via an electrodeposited 64Ni target, and successfully reduced the metallic impurities level of the 64Cu product, such as Co and Ni [21]. Other nuclear reactions examined include 64Ni (d, 2n) 64Cu, 64Zn (d, 2p) 64Cu, 64Zn (n, p) 64Cu [26,27]. In China, researchers also have a growing interest in 64Cu, and the demand of no-carrier added 64Cu has started to increase. Here we report a robust, reliable and user-friendly plating vessel, which can be used for the effective preparation of the 64Ni solid target. The production of 64Cu was performed on a Sumitomo HM-20 biomedical cyclotron (20 MeV) via the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu reaction. The γ-ray spectroscopy of the produced 64Cu solution was also measured to evaluate the radionuclide impurities. After 64Cu was puriﬁed, a labeling experiment to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-Rituximab was performed to examine the quality of 64Cu, including labeling yield and radiochemical purity of the radiotracer, which targets the CD20 antigen, which is expressed on B cell lymphocytes and in the majority of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) [28]. The synthesized radiotracer was further examined by micro-PET imaging using SCID (severe combined immune deﬁciency) mice bearing Ramos RA1 tumors which overexpress CD20 antigen.

Context:  In order to make 64Cu via the nuclear reaction of 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu, we made the enriched 64Ni targets on a gold (Au) disk by electrodeposition of 64Ni from an aqueous solution of 2+ at pH = 9.05, using a robust, reliable and user-friendly apparatus (Figure 1). The Au Ni(NH3)6 disk (30.8 mm diameter × 1.5 mm thickness) was used as a cathode, and a platinum wire was used as an anode. A cavity of 12.1 mm diameter and 0.2 mm depth was milled into the Au disk and 64Ni (99.32%) was plated into this cavity. The 64Ni electroplating was performed with a constant current of 15–25 mA at 2.4–2.6 V in the aqueous solution for 48–72 h. During the electrodeposition, the green color of the 64Ni plating solution gradually faded away and the bubbling of H2 gas was clearly visible. When the 64Ni plating solution became colorless, the electrodeposition was ﬁnished. The absence of Ni2+ was also conﬁrmed by analytical test strips. After cleaning and drying, the plated 64Ni on Au-disk was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, assuming a uniform thickness on the disk.

Context: After irradiation of 5 h, the 64Ni target was dissolved in 6 M hydrochloride acid, and then the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components. The 64Ni was washed out with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling. Due to the elevated cost of enriched 64Ni, recycling of the target material for re-use could reduce the production cost of 64Cu, without sacriﬁcing the quality of subsequent 64Cu production. When the eluted was switched to 1 M HCl, the ﬁrst band coming out was co-produced cobalt radioisotopes (approximately 1 mL), and the second was the 64Cu, which was collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for further use. The separation process of 64Cu took about 2.5 h after irradiation.

Context:  The quality of 64Cu produced was evaluated by analysis of its metallic impurities and measurement of half-life of its radioactivity. The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was used to evaluate the amount of metallic impurities in a decayed 64Cu solution, and showed a concentration of 6.339 ppb of Ni (0.127 µg), 4.112 ppb of Cu (0.082 µg), 5.502 ppb of Zn (0.110 µg), 0.108 ppb of Fe (0.002 µg), 0.102 ppb of Co (0.002 µg), 0.669 ppb of Ga (0.013 µg). The gamma spectrum of the produced 64CuCl2 solution (Figure 3) showed that the 64Cu radionuclide purity was >99%. The half-life of the produced radioactivity was determined by the radioactivity measured at different time points into the following equations: where A is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at time t, A0 is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at 0 h, and λ represents the constant. We obtained the following equation (Figure 4):

Context: The 64Ni targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the enriched 64Ni (99.32%) solution prepared as described above. Electroplating of 64Ni was realized using a plating vessel of our own design and manufacture (Figure 1), where the Au disk was used as a cathode and platinum wire as an anode. The electrodeposition of 64Ni was achieved at 2.4–2.6 V and 15–25 mA with the platinum anode at ~1 cm from the Au disk electrode. This process took 48–72 h. The enriched 64Ni target was irradiated at 12.5 MeV (which decreased by Al) with 20 µA current on a Sumitomo HM-20 cyclotron (20 MeV) for about 5–7 h. 64Cu was produced from the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction.

Context: To assess the quality of the produced 64Cu (quantity, speciﬁc activity and purity), the synthesis of a radiotracer, 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, was performed. Here, the site-speciﬁc modiﬁcation of monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab which contains two DOTA chelator in each antibody was used as we previously reported [29]. The 64CuCl2 solution prepared above was reacted with DOTA-rituximab in a solution of pH = 5.5 at RT for 30 min. After incubation, the radiotracer was puriﬁed using a PD-10 desalting column, and characterized by Radio-TLC and Radio-HPLC, to determine the labeling yield and radiochemical purity. The identity of the radiotracer, 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, was further evaluated by PET imaging, which was carried out on a micro-PET rodent model scanner as reported earlier [29]. After formulation, 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab (0.5 mCi) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of the mice bearing Ramos RA1 tumors (n = 3), which overexpress CD20 antigen, and the animals were imaged with micro-PET at both 24 and 60 h post-injection.

Context: In this study, we presented the improved method for the preparation of 64Cu, especially the improved efﬁciency of electroplating of 64Ni. The 64Ni solid target on an Au-disk has a uniform surface, with the thickness of 10.73 µm, and no metallic impurities. The total plated 64Ni was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2 (assuming a uniform thickness). After irradiation of the target and puriﬁcation, the gamma spectrum of the produced 64Cu showed its radionuclide purity to be >99%, with both peaks at 511 keV and 1346 keV. In addition, the produced 64CuCl2 solution has high speciﬁc activity up to 5.6 GBq/µmoL. It was further incorporated into the modiﬁed monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was further used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: In this study, we presented the improved method for the preparation of 64Cu, especially the improved efﬁciency of electroplating of 64Ni. The 64Ni solid target on an Au-disk has a uniform surface, with the thickness of 10.73 µm, and no metallic impurities. The total plated 64Ni was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2 (assuming a uniform thickness). After irradiation of the target and puriﬁcation, the gamma spectrum of the produced 64Cu showed its radionuclide purity to be >99%, with both peaks at 511 keV and 1346 keV. In addition, the produced 64CuCl2 solution has high speciﬁc activity up to 5.6 GBq/µmoL.

Context: Abstract—The results of destructive radiochemical and elemental analysis of samples of experimental mixed nitride uranium-plutonium (MNUP) fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor are presented. Data on the nuclide composition and weight content of U, Pu, Am, Cm, Nd were obtained, the speciﬁ c activity of 14C, 3H, 106Ru, the weight content of Zr, Mo, Pd, Rh in solution and in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF were determined. The burn-up depth of MNUP fuel is calculated from the ratio of the number of ﬁ ssion product atoms, burn-up monitor, to the number of heavy atoms. The total accumulation of 145Nd and 146Nd isotopes, as well as 148Nd, was used as burn-up monitor.

Context: the MNUP SNF composition are limited. The literature reports radiochemical analysis data on MNUP fuel irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor [2]. In [2] the isotopic composition and weight content of U, Pu, Ce, Cs, Am, and Nd nuclides were detected and in these data the fuel burn- up was determined, 2.57% of heavy atoms (h.a.). The work [3] presents data on the 14C speciﬁ c activity. In studies [4, 5], a method was developed for determining the 3H speciﬁ c activity in the SNF MNUP. The authors of [6] report data on determining the weight content of 232U and 236Pu nuclides in the SNF MNUP by the α-spectrometry method. This study presents the results of comprehensive studies of samples of experimental MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 fast breeder reactor.

Context: the MNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1, and a series of model experiments to prove the completeness of the oxidation of various carbon forms to CO2 and the capture of the resulting carbon dioxide by alkaline traps [3], as well as the results of testing KETVS-1 for the content of iodine isotopes. After cooling the MNUP SNF solution to room temperature, the reﬂ ux condenser was replaced with a refrigerator, and part of the SNF solution was distilled oﬀ at a temperature of 110–120°C. The condensate was collected in a 50 mL volumetric ﬂ ask. The tritium content was determined in view of a preset proportionality coeﬃ cient (Kpr), which takes into account the tritium fraction that passed from solution to condensate. At a volume of the MNUP SNF initial nitric acid solution of 250 mL and a condensate volume of 50 mL, Kpr = 0.24 ± 0.02 [4]. The activity of 3H in the condensate solution and 14C in alkaline solutions of Petri absorbers was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The part of the SNF solution remaining after distillation was ﬁ ltered through a double cellulose “blue ribbon” ﬁ lter 11.0 cm in diameter with a pore size of 1–3 μm to separate the undissolved residue. The ﬂ ask with the initial solution remains was washed three times with 1 M HNO3 (25 mL). The washing solutions were used to rinse the ﬁ lters and combined with the basic SNF solution remaining after distillation. The double cellulose ﬁ lter with the undissolved residue of the SNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was separated. Each ﬁ lter was dissolved, and the contents of U, Pu, Zr, Mo, Pd, and Rh were determined in the resulting solutions.

Context: Uranium was determined by the spectrophotometric measurement of the light absorption of the uranium com- plex with arsenazo III; plutonium, by α-spectrometry; and ﬁ ssion products, by the atomic emission spectral method. The testing procedure is described in detail in [2]. At the ﬁ nal stage, 8 M HNO3 solution (200 mL) was added to a ﬂ ask with an undissolved fuel cladding, and control dissolution was carried out at a temperature of 95–100°C for 5 h. Upon dissolution process completion the α- and γ-spectrometric analyzes of the solutions were performed after the main and control dissolutions. The analytical line energies of radionuclides, their yields, as well as the half-lives for calculating the speciﬁ c activities of radionuclides when calculating their volumetric activity in term of concentration, were taken from [7, 8]. The isolation and puriﬁ cation of elements was car- ried out using a combination of cation-, anion-exchange, and extraction chromatograpy. The techniques devel- oped at RIAR were taken as the basis for the separation of SNF components. The isotopic composition of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, and Cm was determined in the isolated fractions. The analysis procedure is described in detail in [2–6, 9–11]. Quantitative determination of the U, Pu, Nd content was carried out by repeating the procedure for their isolation in the presence of a complex label by isotope dilution with mass spectrometric ending.

Context: The control dissolution of the fuel cladding was carried out upon completion of the dissolution process and separation of the undissolved residue. According to the data of α- and γ-spectrometric measurements of solutions, the content of α-emitters in the control solution is (3 ± 0.3) × 10–3% of their amount in the initial solution, content of γ-emitters is 0.1 ± 0.01%. The results of determining the burn-up depth, 3H, 14C, 106Ru speciﬁ c activities in MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor, in comparison with the results, which we obtained earlier for MNUP fuel irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor, are presented in Table 3. The discrepancy between the results of determining the tritium speciﬁ c activity is due to diﬀ erent types of reactor plants and fuel composition irradiation modes, as well as the degree of 3H diﬀ usion through the fuel cladding. Studies [13, 14] state that one of the main factors determining the tritium speciﬁ c activity in SNF is the fuel temperature at the irradiation time. As the temperature rises, the tritium content in the fuel composition diminishes. It was shown in [14–16] that tritium formed during SNF irradiation diﬀ uses through the fuel element cladding by 95–99%. Our data on the tritium speciﬁ c activity in the fuel cladding agree with the results of [17], where the tritium speciﬁ c activity in the fuel cladding with uranium oxide fuel and burn-up of 6.6–7.1% was 1.2 × 105 Bq/g. At the same time, it was found in [18] that the tritium content in the fuel element cladding of the VVER-440 reactor has a signiﬁ cant spread and is in the range from 3.9 × 106 to 3.4 × 107 Bq/g. The authors note that the uneven distribution of tritium is observed both along the height and along the circumference of the fuel-element cladding. They conclude that the main part of the tritium enters the cladding through areas of a damaged protective zirconium oxide ﬁ lm. From data presented in Table 3, it can be seen that the burn-up values of the MNUP SNF samples and the 14C speciﬁ c activity in them change symbatically. With increasing in the burn-up of the analyzed SNF sample by 23%, the 14C speciﬁ c activity increased by 25%. In the course of SNF dissolution, ruthenium is distributed over all elements of the dissolution apparatus: it partially remains in the SNF solution, condenses on the inner walls of the dephlegmator and connecting hoses, water cooler, enters the solution of the ﬁ rst Petri absorber containing the HNO3 solution, passes into the condensate solution produced at the tritium speciﬁ c activity determination stage, remains in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF.

Context:  be 8.2 × 103 Bq, and the 129I speciﬁ c activity will be 41 Bq/mL. For radiochemical studies of SNF samples, a hundredfold dilution of the initial solution is utilizsed. We failed to determine the 129I content in a dilute solution against the background of other SNF components. For detecting iodine, it is necessary to develop special procedures for its isolation from a SNF sample. The results of determining the isotopic composition and weight content of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, Cm in the MNUP SNF are given in Table 4. In parentheses are the values of the total absolute error in units of the last digits of the result for a conﬁ dence level of 0.95. When ﬁ ltering the MNUP SNF solution through a double cellulose ﬁ lter, a light gray coating was observed on the upper ﬁ lter. The sediment weight could not be ﬁ xed, since the initial weight of the cellulose ﬁ lter turned out to be greater than the weight of the ﬁ lter with sediment. This experimental fact is probably associated with the destruction of cellulose under the action of α- and γ-emitting nuclides. According to the data of [19–21], the sediment weight upon uranium oxide SNF dissolution in nitric acid is no more than 0.6% of the dissolved fuel weight. It was found in [22] that, upon dissolution of irradiated mixed-oxide fuel with a burn- up of 31.7 to 54.7 GW/t in 3 HNO3 at 95°С, the the undissolved sediment weight does not exceed 1.3% of the SNF weight. When studying the dissolution of model nitride SNF [23], the volumes of 7.8 and 9.44 M HNO3 required for dissolution were calculated based on the nal concentration of metals in the solution: 280 and ﬁ 400 g/L, respectively. It is shown that the weight of the undissolved residue is 1.8 and 2.26%, respectively. The results of detecting the content of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the solution and the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 5. The presence of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr was registered only on the upper cellulose ﬁ lter; there were no these elements on the lower ﬁ lter. The content of these elements in the solution obtained after the dissolution of the upper ﬁ lter was equivalent to their content in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF. The total weight of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 was 0.0019 g, which is 0.07% of the dissolved SNF weight. The results of determining the uranium and plutonium content in the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 6. The data in Table 6 indicate that the U and Pu contents in the upper and lower ﬁ lters are comparable. The close values of these quantities evidence that most of the U and Pu we found in solutions after the dissolution of the lters were sorbed by cellulose. ﬁ The excess of the U content in the upper ﬁ lter compared to the lower ﬁ lter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds. The weight of undissolved U estimated from the diﬀ erence between the U weight on the upper and lower ﬁ lters, is 2.5 mg, or 0.09% of the total uranium content in the analyzed SNF sample.

Abstract: The emerging success of [68Ga/177Lu]Ga/Lu-DOTATATE as a theranostic pair has spurred interest in other isotopes as potential theranostic combinations. Here, we review cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m as a potential theranostic pair. Radionuclidically pure cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m have been produced on small cyclotrons with high molar activity. In vitro, DOTATOC labeled with cobalt has shown greater afﬁnity for SSTR2 than DOTATOC labeled with gallium and yttrium. Similarly, [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE has shown improved cell-killing capabilities as compared to DOTATATE labeled with either indium-111 or lutetium-177. Finally, PET imaging with an isotope such as cobalt- 55 allows for image acquisition at much later timepoints than gallium, allowing for an increased degree of biological clearance of non-bound radiotracer. We discuss the accelerator targetry and radiochemistry used to produce cobalt-55,58m, emphasizing the implications of these techniques to downstream radiotracers being developed for imaging and therapy.

Context: Radiopharmaceuticals are clinically useful for the diagnosis and treatment of dis- ease [1–5]. However, quantifying radiopharmaceuticals’ dosimetry is challenging [6]. Matching diagnostic radionuclides with chemically similar therapeutics creates a “thera- nostic” pair, helping to resolve this problem [7]. The success of theranostic pairs has led to the re-evaluation of several radionuclides as potential radiopharmaceuticals, with the most popular in recent times being gallium-68 (t1/2 = 68 min, β+ = 89%, Emax= 1899 keV) and lutetium-177 (t1/2 = 6.7 d, Eβ- = 134 keV) [8]. The availability of both gallium-68 and lutetium-177 and the success of conjugating a myriad of targeting vectors to them have led to their widespread adoption in the nuclear medicine community. However, several short- comings exist for these two radionuclides; namely, the short half-life of gallium-68 limits the range of its applicability, and the resistance of some cancers to lutetium-177-labelled radiopharmaceuticals has prompted a search for other therapeutic radionuclides [9]. Addi- tionally, although gallium-68 and lutetium-177 have been used as a theranostic pair, slight chemical differences between the two may complicate dosimetric calculations and/or lead to subtle biological incongruities [10]. Using compounds labelled with the same chemical element can obviate this problem and allow the same protocols to be used in forming and purifying chemical complexes [11]. Cobalt-55 (t1/2 = 17.53 h, β+ = 77%, Eγ = 931.1 keV, Iγ = 75%) and cobalt-58m (t1/2 = 9.10 h, IC= 100%) are one of the most promising of such pairs identiﬁed due to their identical chemical properties coupled to similar half-lives and high in vivo stability and compatibility with many chelators which can be coupled with tar-

Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradi- ation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

Context: Cobalt-55 production was reported in 1938 from alpha irradiation of manganese [18] and has since been reported from many target materials and incident beams. Practically, two reactions are best suited for producing activities of cobalt-55 with few impurities: 58Ni(p,α)55Co and 54Fe(d,n)55Co, which are accessible on low energy cyclotrons [19]. These reactions have been thoroughly and recently reviewed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and signiﬁcant independent efforts resulting in recommended excitation functions for the reactions discussed below [20]. The 58Ni(p,α)55Co reaction has been employed by many groups [14,21–24]. Sev- eral radioisotopic and radionuclidic impurities can be formed in this process. Cobalt-57 (t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 1377 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is produced from 58Ni(p,2p)57Co above 15 MeV [23], and production of cobalt-56 occurs above 25 MeV [25]. Nickel-57 (t1/2 = 35.68 h, β+ = 44%, Eγ= 1377.6 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is primarily produced via the 58Ni(p,2p)57Cu, which decays to nickel-57 with a half-life of 196 ms [21]. This reaction occurs above the threshold of 12 MeV, and is useful for monitoring separation efﬁciency during process development. However, nickel-57 decays to cobalt-57, which cannot be separated from cobalt-55. Natural nickel targets can also be used, but result in increased impurities that limit downstream clinical work [26]. Cobalt-55 can also be produced by the 54Fe(d,n)55Co reaction [27]. Theoretically, this method affords radioisotopically pure cobalt-55 compared with the proton-induced route described above, avoiding cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Practically, purities are limited by the achievable enrichment of the iron-56 target. The excitation function peaks near 7 MeV (Figure 1) [28]. Finally, manganese-52m is also coproduced via the 54Fe(d,α)52mMn reaction, which has a threshold energy of 4 MeV [28].

Context:  beam captures the maximum of the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo excitation function while minimizing the radioisotopic impurity-producing reactions. Figure 3. Previously reported excitation functions for (a) 58Fe(p,2n)57Co and (b) 58Fe(p,3n)56Co, measured using isotopically enriched targets [32]. Irradiating isotopically enriched iron-58 avoids the production of other impurities that cannot be separated out in the downstream chemistry. Natural iron is composed of iron-54 (5.8%), iron-56 (91.7%), iron-57 (2.2%), and iron-58 (0.3%). Proton bombardment of iron-54 leads to the production of very short-lived contaminants such as 54Fe(p,n)54Co (t1/2 = 1.46 m) and 54Fe(p,2n)53Co (t1/2 = 0.24 s) that do not diminish the radioisotopic purity of cobalt-58m. However, higher-energy proton reactions on iron-56 and iron-57, as described above for iron-58, may form longer-lived radioisotopic impurities cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Measured data from the relevant excitation functions are shown below in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4. Measured excitation functions for 56Fe(p,n)56Co (a) and 56Fe(p,2n)55Co (b) [32,33,41–45].

Context: Deuteron bombardments can be used to produce cobalt-58m from enriched iron-57 via the (d,n) reaction, natural iron targets via the (d,n) reaction on iron-57 (2.2% abundance) or (d,2n) reaction on iron-56 (91.7%). Higher stopping power for deuterons reduces the quantity of isotopically enriched target material required, and deuteron-induced reactions’ excitation functions are often higher than similar reactions incited by proton beams. How- ever, the relative thermal power density deposited in the target by the deuteron beam is higher than for protons. Accelerators with deuteron beams are also less common, and where they do exist, they usually have energies too low to utilize the entirety of even (d,n) excitation functions. Deuteron irradiations to produce cobalt-58m proceed on iron isotopes iron-57 and iron-58, which both exist in relatively low abundance, so as with proton irradiations, signiﬁcant costs are associated with target materials. As in Figure 2, in Figure 6 “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the isomer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. Figure 6 above plots the excitation functions of natFe(d,xn) reactions that form cobalt-58m/g and enriched iron-57 can be used to increase yields and purities. Using lower-energy deuterons reduces the likelihood of the 57Fe(d,2n)57Co reaction occurring, which has a threshold energy of 3.9 MeV [40]. Overall, an enriched iron-57 target reduces radioisotopic impurities within the cobalt-58m sample. The possible 57Co-producing reactions excitation functions are shown in Figure 7. Sudar and Qaim examined the production ratio of the ground and metastable isomers of cobalt-58 from deuteron irradiations of natural iron targets [29] based on the assumptions that deuteron capture and iron-58 target reactions’ contributions are small, but to our knowledge, no measurements have been made of the formation of cobalt-58m/g using separated iron-57.

Context:  Though the proton- and deuteron-induced reactions are most accessible to the majority of modern cyclotrons, there are alternative routes utilizing helium-4 ions, neutrons, or helium-3 nucleus with comparable cross sections [75–77]. Alpha beams afford a particularly attractive reaction route using monoisotopic manganese targets via 55Mn(α,n)58mCo. The measured excitation functions are shown below in Figure 12a. If higher-energy alpha beams are used, cobalt-57 can be formed from 55Mn(α,2n), as shown in Figure 12b. To decrease the likelihood of producing this contaminant, lower- energy beams should be employed to capture the greatest cross section for the 55Mn(α,n)58Co reaction while minimizing the 55Mn(α,2n)57Co reaction.

Context:  Figure 12. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-58 from (α,n) reaction (a) and cobalt-57 (b) on manganese- 55 [29,30,32,35,78–84]. In addition to charged particle-induced reactions, several alternative and less prag- matic routes to cobalt-58m can be contemplated, e.g., quasi-monoenergetic neutron or triton irradiations. Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons can be produced via 2H(d,n)3He re- action on hydrogen-2 gas targets. The neutrons bombard nickel or cobalt induce the 58Ni(n,p)58mCo and 59Co(n,2n)58mCo reactions [29,75]. Tritons can be generated via the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction within a nuclear reactor with an energy of 2.736 MeV. These ions go on to bombard [56Fe]Fe2O3 targets to produce cobalt-58m,g via the 56Fe(t,n)58mCo reaction route [76,85]. These alternative reactions currently rely on rare accelerator infrastructure or on signiﬁcantly increased scale in terms of beam intensities. Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations. These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts. A com- parison of the experimentally determined thick target yields and theoretical yields are shown in Figures 13–16. Figure 13.

Context:  Figure 16. Thick target yield comparison between theoretical data and experimentally collected data for iron-58 targets at 10.1 MeV [87]. As mentioned above, the co-production of cobalt-58g with cobalt-58m is unavoidable. Valdovinos et al. determined that through the 57Fe(d,n)58gCo production route, cobalt-58g has an experimental yield of 131.5 ± 19.7 KBq/µA-h at 8.2 MeV with integrated currents ranging from 90 to 124 µA-h [26]. This impurity poses an issue to the application of cobalt- 58m due its long half-life and concomitant gamma emissions [88]. However, cobalt-58g can be useful for PET imaging of the biodistribution of radiolabeled agents. This potentially allows for determination of these agents’ biodistribution at timepoints many days after injection [89]. A summary of the discussed pragmatic production methods is shown in Table 2 below, highlighting the isotope produced, material needed with respective natural abundance, the reaction that must occur, and the possible radio-contaminants that may be co-produced.

Context:  Using the table above, it can be suggested that for the production of cobalt-55, iron-54 targets should be utilized based on the lack of potential long-lived radio-contaminants co-produced, and an increased yield at lower thickness targets when compared to yields produced by nickel-58. To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelera- tor capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

Context: Targets of nickel and iron are relatively easy to fabricate; most literature reports describe electrochemical preparations because of the thermal and electrical conductivity of the resulting metal deposits, and presumably due to their compatibility with efforts to reuse costly separated materials. Nickel powder, natural or enriched, can be plated onto a silver or gold backings via electrodeposition with ﬁnal deposited nickel masses between 45 and 200 mg [14,26]. The procedure follows closely to the methods for plating nickel-64 for the production of copper- 64 [90,91]. In a generally representative process, nickel-58 powder is dissolved in 6 M HNO3, dried and reconstituted in 2.3 mL of 2.4 M H2SO4. The plating solution is adjusted pH 9 using 28% NH4OH and 270–300 mg of (NH4)2SO4 and transferred to a circular elec- troplating cell that consists of a Teﬂon base that is connected to the gold coin, allowing for a 5 mm plating diameter [26]. With graphite or platinum anodes, a DC voltage of 2.5–3.6 V is applied, producing currents ranging from 8 to 116 mA. Masses of 45–55 mg are deposited in ~12 h and larger masses (100–200 mg) take 2–3 days to quantitatively electroplate onto the cathode [14,26] leaving a clear and colorless electrolyte behind. Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 µL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell. Thisgaard et al. explains a different method for electroplating iron powder, adapted from Zaman and Qaim [28]. In this method, iron powder is dissolved in 1 mL of H2SO4 under nitrogen-atmosphere. once dissolved, the solution is diluted with distilled water to 5 mL in order to have a pH of 1.5. This solution is then used for the plating process on a silver backing, where the current density is reported as 28–35 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h with a ﬁxed voltage of 7.3 V. [87]. Another form of target fabrication is to press elemental enriched iron into 5 mm diameter pellets. Enriched iron material can come in the form of Fe2O3. If made from the oxide form, the target will have poor thermal conductivity. Therefore, the enriched Fe2O3 is reduced to elemental form by heating the powder at 800 ◦C for 4 h in a hydrogen tube furnace [86].

Context:  4. Radiochemical Isolation and Preparation 4.1. Anion-Exchange Chromatography Because both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m require isolation from iron or nickel target materials, many of the radiochemical isolation processes reported can be applied to multiple production schemes. Several anion-exchange resins such as Dowex-2, Amberlite IRA-400, and ANEX-L have been historically used for the separation of Co from various transition metals in HCl, HNO3, and HBr solutions [94]. Previously reported separation methods to remove nickel from cobalt used the AG 1 × 8 anion-exchange resin [14,24]. These methods included the use of multiple grams of resin packed into a glass column and equilibrated with 9 M HCl. The dissolved target solution in 9M HCl was loaded onto the column where the nickel elutes from the column in the eluate and 9M HCl wash in 10–40 mL. The cobalt-5x, which remains on the column during the large 9M HCl wash, is eluted from the column in 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl. The eluted cobalt fraction can then be evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in various matrices for further analysis and/or radiolabeling experiments. Anion-exchange chromatography also isolates cobalt-5x from iron target material [94]. After dissolving the target in acid, the iron is oxidized into the 3+ state with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of loading the cobalt-5x on to the anion-exchange resin and washing away the target material, as was performed in the nickel/cobalt anion-exchange separation, cobalt and iron are retained on the column when loaded. The cobalt can then be eluted form the anion-exchange column in 4 M HCl. The iron target will remain on the column during the 4 M HCl wash, but can be recovered in low concentrations of HCl. The HCl eluant containing cobalt-5x can also be evaporated and the cobalt-5x reconstituted in alternative matrices without incurring signiﬁcant losses [26,28,86,87]. Separation of cobalt-5x from manganese is similar to the isolation of cobalt-5x from nickel targets, but can use even less concentrated acidic media. As summarized by Bate and Leddicotte in “The Radiochemistry of Cobalt”, manganese in a dissolved target solution passes through a AG1 × 8 anion-exchange resin in HCl concentrations > 4.5 HCl. Once the target material is removed, the column can be washed with <4.5 M HCl to elute cobalt-5x [94].

Context:  The separation of cobalt-5x from iron-5x uses a two column technique, as shown in Figure 18. An AG1X8 anion-exchange resin packed column is used for the bulk separation of iron and cobalt, then a DGA column serves as a “clean up” to further improve the puriﬁcation of cobalt-5x [26]. While there has not been a publication speciﬁcally on the separation of manganese target material from cobalt-55,58m, the work performed by Pourmand et al. suggests branched DGA can also be used for radio-chemical isolation using 4–6 M HCl, where in this range manganese 2+ has minimal afﬁnity for the resin, and cobalt 2+ has a greater afﬁnity [95].

Context: The somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are a family of 5 G protein-coupled receptors that contain somatostatin-binding extracellular domains [101]. Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102]. Variations of somatostatin have been developed to bind to the SSTRs for the detection and treatment of cancers. These analogs deviate from the base structure of SST in ways that increase binding speciﬁcity and plasma stability [103]. The first agent approved for PET imaging of SSTR2 was [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE (Netspot) in 2016 [104]. Since its approval, there has been interest in developing a PET agent for somatostatin receptor imaging with a longer half-life than gallium-68 to simplify patient logistics and to image longer time courses post injection with improved clearance from blood and non-target tissues. In a study published in 2008, Heppeler et al. investigated the effect of changing the metal ion on the afﬁnity of DOTATOC for SSTR analogs and compared their results to those published by Reubi et al. [105,106]. They found that Co-DOTATOC has higher afﬁnity than DOTATOC labeled with gallium and yttrium as well as octreotide [106]. Biodistribution studies of [57Co]Co-DOTATOC in mice with AR42J tumors revealed high (25% ID/g) tumor uptake at 4 h post injection (PI), even higher than the kidneys which are a clearance route for peptides. However, the tumor to kidney ratio did not increase at the 24 h timepoint. Crystallography with Ga- and Co-DOTA revealed similar pseudooctahedral geometry but differing charge states which may explain their differing binding afﬁnities [106]. This work led to a proof-of-concept study radiolabeling DOTATOC with cobalt- 55,56,58m [14]. In this study, the authors produced Co isotopes using the following reac- tions: 54Fe(d,n)55Co, natFe(p,x)56Co, and 58Fe(p,n)58mCo. They measured molar activities of >4 MBq/nmol for [58mCo]Co-DOTATOC and >0.21 MBq/nmol for [55Co]Co-DOTATOC, but [56Co]Co-DOTATOC wasnwas not examined [16]. Thisgaard et al. followed this work with a comparative in vivo evaluation of 57Co- labeled DOTATOC, DOTANOC, and DOTATATE with [111In]In-DOTATATE [107]. In a head-to-head comparison in AR42J cells, the three 57Co-labeled somatostatin analogues were found to have between 49 and 123% higher cellular uptake as compared to [111In]In- DOTATATE. All agents showed similar levels of nuclear translocation, with less than 10% of nuclear translocation observed up to 3 h post addition. The cell-killing abil- ity of the Auger emitter [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was also compared to the beta emitter [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE and the Auger emitter [111In]In-DOTATATE. At low concentra- tions, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was more effective in causing DNA damage than 111In- labeled or 177Lu-labeled, while at higher concentrations the [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE was most effective. When the cell-killing assay was normalized to cumulative decays, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was consistently most effective at all concentrations tested. The authors attributed the limited degree of cell killing demonstrated by lutetium-177 to the cells being grown in monolayer, which restricts the ability of the emitted electrons to cross into adjacent cells to do damage. The superiority of 58mCo-over 111In-labeled DOTATATE may also be attributed to the higher binding afﬁnity of the cobalt-labeled DOTATATE for SSTR2. Similarly to the 2008 study, the authors performed a biodistribution study with [57Co]Co-DOTATATE and found high tumor uptake 1–4 h PI. By 4 h, most uptake in organs with SSTR2 expression such as the stomach and pancreas had greatly decreased [106].

Context:  the 55Co- and 64Cu-labeled agents showed a nonsigniﬁcant trend towards higher uptake than [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE. Tumor to organ ratios increased for [55Co]Co-DOTATATE at the 4 h and 24 h PI imaging times, with ratios of tumor to liver, kidney, and muscle higher than [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE. PET imaging showed that for all 3 agents, blood activity had mostly cleared by 1 h PI. For the [55Co]Co-DOTATATE, kidneys and liver did not appear on the images at 4 and 24 h PI, while liver uptake was apparent in the 64Cu-labeled version at 24 h PI. The authors also used the mouse biodistribution to estimate human dosimetry. They found that most organs would receive relatively low doses from [55Co]Co- DOTATATE (<0.2 × 10−2 mSv/MBq), while the lungs (6.5 × 10−2 mSv/MBq) and stomach (2.1 × 10−2 mSv/MBq) would receive higher doses.

Imaging at later timepoint images showed near-complete non-target clearance using [55Co]Co-DOTATATE while [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE showed non-speciﬁc liver uptake [15].

Context:  In summary, it appears that cobalt-labeled somatostatin receptor-targeted agents have the highest afﬁnity ever observed for SSTR2. DOTATATE labeled with cobalt-55 shows improved imaging characteristics as compared to DOTATATE labeled with copper-64 as nontarget uptake in the liver is reduced. As a therapeutic, [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE has shown promise as an effective auger emitter as it is has high afﬁnity for SSTR2 and is internalized to a high degree. Using cobalt-55- and cobalt-58m-labeled DOTATATE together as a theranostic pair is an enticing prospect.

Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popu- lar imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist pep- tides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding afﬁnity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding afﬁnity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110]. The ﬁrst cobalt-55 imaging of GRPR was reported in 2016 by Dam et al. [111] and compared 55Co-, 57Co-, and 68Ga-labeled GRPR agonist NOTA-AMBA (NOTA-Gly-4-ABz- Gln-Trp-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) in a PC3 prostate cancer. 57Co- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA-AMBA were found to have similar receptor afﬁnities, serum stabilities, and phar- macokinetics at 1 h and 4 h PI [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA enabled PET imaging at a 24 h timepoint (and beyond) which is not possible with [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-AMBA and revealed encouraging clearance of the tracer and stable late uptake of [5xCo]Co-NOTA-AMBA in the tumor [111]. In 2017, Mitran et al. reported radiolabeling GRPR antagonist RM26 (NOTA-PEG2- [D-Phe, Sta, Leu] bombesin [6–14]) with cobalt-55 and cobalt-57 [13]. Cell binding and internalization were investigated in PC3 cells and a mouse PC3 xenograft tumor model. They observed 12% cell internalization at 24 h which is similar to what has been reported for [111In]In-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 [112]. Biodistribution studies in PC3 tumor-bearing mice showed that at 3 h PI the tumor uptake was greater than uptake in any other organ including the kidneys. PET imaging studies using [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 showed clear tumor uptake at 3 h PI and by 24 h PI the tumor showed high uptake (Figure 20). The IC50 for Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (5.54 ± 0.4 nM) [10] is approximately 10-fold higher than Co-NOTA-AMBA (0.46 ± 0.20 nM) [13,111]. In vivo comparisons between [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA and [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 are complicated as the early imaging times are not matched between studies. However, comparison at the 24 h timepoint shows greater uptake of [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA than [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 in the tumor as well as many other organs. Even though the tumor uptake was less, the tumor to organ ratios for [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 were sometimes 100-fold greater than what was observed with [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. This was most notable in tissues with high GRPR expression such as the colon, pancreas, and stomach. The 24 h PI PET images provided, with both papers similarly showing lower non-target organ accumulation with the [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 than with [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. Recently, Mitran et al. investigated the impact chelator modiﬁcation had on PEG2- RM26 cell binding, internalization, and biodistribution in PC-3 prostate cancer [113]. PEG2- RM26 was bound to NOTA, DOTA, NODAGA, or DOTAGA and radiolabeled with cobalt- 55 and cobalt-57. The NOTA- and DOTA-labeled peptides showed the highest uptake in PC-3 cells in vitro and DOTA-labeled peptide had the highest tumor uptake in vivo by 24 h PI. In PET imaging studies, NOTA and DOTA PEG2-RM26 showed near-complete clearance of the radiotracer from the kidneys and GI tract by 24 h, whereas NODAGA and DOTAGA had residual GI and kidney uptake respectively.

Context: More recently, bombesin analogues have been supplanted by prostate-speciﬁc mem- brane antigen (PSMA)-targeting agents in prostate cancer imaging, culminating in the NDA approval for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 [114–116]. In 2017, Dam et al. compared 68Ga and 55/57Co- labeled PSMA-617 with in vitro-speciﬁc binding and internalization assays in LNCaP and PC3-PIP cells [12]. Observed KD values for both agents were similar to [111In]In-PSMA- 617 [117]. In LNCaP cells incubated with [57Co]CoPSMA-617, >60% of the cell associated radioactivity was internalized after 30 min of incubation, which was higher than 68Ga-, 177Lu-, or 44Sc-labeled PSMA-617 [117,118]. PET imaging with [55Co]Co-PSMA-617 shows selective tumor uptake by 20 min P.I. and was sustained at 24 h PI. Additionally, by 24 h, tumor uptake was found to be higher than any other organ, including the kidneys [12]. Due to the improved internalization proﬁle and very high tumor uptake, it appears that [58mCo]Co-PSMA-617 would be a prime agent to be used for therapy. This is supported by its relatively rapid clearance in nontarget organs, especially the kidney.

In LNCaP cells incubated with [57Co]CoPSMA-617, >60% of the cell associated radioactivity was internalized after 30 min of incubation, which was higher than 68Ga-, 177Lu-, or 44Sc-labeled PSMA-617 [117,118]. PET imaging with [55Co]Co-PSMA-617 shows selective tumor uptake by 20 min P.I. and was sustained at 24 h PI. Additionally, by 24 h, tumor uptake was found to be higher than any other organ, including the kidneys [12]. Due to the improved internalization proﬁle and very high tumor uptake, it appears that [58mCo]Co-PSMA-617 would be a prime agent to be used for therapy. This is supported by its relatively rapid clearance in nontarget organs, especially the kidney.

Context:  (NODAGA tagged) [121]. In vitro and in vivo up uptake waweres evaluated in the KB cervical cancer cell line which expresses high levels of FR [122]. The two agents had similar uptake and biodistributions, achieving >15% ID/g in xenografted tumors and underwent renal clearance [121]. Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu- labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124]. Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of speciﬁcity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difﬁcult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.

Context: The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is a cell surface protein involved in cell growth, replication, angiogenesis and differentiation. It is overexpressed by many breast cancers, and expression status is used to determine eligibility for some therapies [127]. Detection of HER2 receptor status can be assessed with imaging, and [89Zr]Zr-trastuzumab has been evaluated in several clinical trials. However, when using a fully intact antibody such as trastuzumab, blood clearance is delayed and imaging is typically performed 4–5 days after injection of the radiotracer [128]. Additionally, use of full-sized antibodies for imaging results in high liver uptake as the antibodies clear through the hepatobiliary pathway. This property may result in obscurement of liver metastases. Use of a truncated antibody, such as a minibody, diabody, or fragment antibody for imaging allows for more rapid clearance, typically via the kidneys [129]. Using these constructs allows for imaging on the same day or next day, which means that a radionuclide with a shorter half-life than zirconium-89 may be preferred. With that in mind, an afﬁbody for HER2 (DOTA-Z2395-C) was developed and 57Co- labeled (as a substitute for cobalt-55) [130]. In vitro studies with the 57Co-labeled HER2 afﬁbody revealed that radiolabeling conditions only slightly reduced immunoreactivity of the afﬁbody. In vitro, approximately 20% of the tracer internalized over 24 h in SKOV- 3 ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, biodistribution was similar to what was observed with [111In]In-DOTA-Z2395-C [131]. Blood clearance was rapid, falling from 0.5 to 0.027 % ID/g between 1 and 24 h PI. SPECT imaging of [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C at 4 h PI in mice bearing LS174T tumors (low HER2) and SKOV-3 tumors (high HER-2) revealed blockable tumor uptake and kidney clearance [130]. Like HER2, HER3 is overexpressed by certain cancer types. Additionally, HER3 ex- pression changes in response to therapy, increasing in tissues as they become resistant to HER2 targeted therapies [132]. As immunotherapies to HER3 are developed, it becomes important to develop tools to detect HER3 status in tumors [133]. Hence, an afﬁbody which targets HER3 (HEHEHE-ZHER3) was conjugated with NOTA and radiolabeled with 57Co [134]. In vitro, incubation of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 with cells expressing low HER3 (DU145) and high HER3 (LS174T) showed better total binding to LS174T (~15% vs. 4% for DU145). Internalization was observed to be higher with the DU145 cells, with approxi- mately 50% of activity internalized by DU145 at 24 h, and less than 10% internalization seen with LS174T. As expected, the high expression line LS174T showed greater tumor binding in vivo, which was effectively blocked with non-labeled ZHER3. Uptake was also seen in tissues which have endogenous expression of HER3, namely the liver and intestines. Clearance occurred primarily through the kidneys. By 24 h PI, imaging showed that much of the activity in the liver and intestines had cleared [134].

Context:  Further investigation into the ZHER3 afﬁbody involved modifying the chelator to determine if imaging qualities could be improved [135]. In addition to NOTA, which was used previously, DOTA-, NODAGA-, and DOTAGA-tagged ZHER3 were 57Co labeled. In vitro assays showed nearly equal, blockable binding of the afﬁbody conjugated DOTA, NODAGA, and DOTAGA. The measured equilibrium disassociation constants, KD, were 0.2 nM for DOTA and DOTAGA constructs and 0.1 nM for the NOTA and NODAGA con- structs. Interestingly, the internalization fraction of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 in DU145 cells was observed to be 5% over 24 h, while their previous study showed as compared to 50% in their previous study [134]. In vivo, [57Co]Co-(NOTA/NODAGA/DOTA/DOTAGA)- ZHER3 were compared at 3 h and 24 h PI.

[57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was compared to [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 at 3 h post injection and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was followed to 24 h (see Figure 21 below). At 3 h, [68Ga]Ga- NODAGA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor uptake but lower blood, liver, and small intestine uptake. By 24 h, [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor to organ ratios as 68Ga at 3 h PI [135]. Figure 21. Chemical structures and charges of studied cobalt-chelate complexes (A).

Context:  57Co-labeled [137,138]. [68Ga]Ga- DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 uptake was measured in mice bearing A431 tumors. Interestingly [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 outperformed [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 at 3 h PI, showing higher tumor uptake and lower liver and spleen uptake. When biodistribution was performed in mice injected with [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 at 24 h PI, a reduction in blood activity was observed and was accompanied by only minor reduction in activity in other organs. Similarly, imaging showed much less liver uptake using the 57Co-labeled agent than the 68Ga-labeled agent. This radionuclide-dependent uptake led the authors to speculate that liver binding may be due to more than EGFR targeting in the liver. Because their blocking dose only partly blocked liver binding, they theorize that the neutral charge on the Ga-DOTA complex gives it higher afﬁnity for scavenger receptors in the liver. The reduction in liver binding may leave more afﬁbody available for tumor binding, explaining the higher tumor binding observed with [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377. Attempts to produce a therapeutic compound labeled with 58mCo would likely have to contend with poor intracellular internalization and high kidney uptake, similar to the challenges faced in the development of PSMA-targeted ligands. Additionally, EGFR targeting would cause a signiﬁcant radioactive dose to the liver.

Context: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) helps promote vascular development in tissues. overexpression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in some types of cancer [139,140]. A VEGF-targeting peptide L19K-FDNB was conjugated to NO2A or DO3A and labeled with cobalt-55 for PET imaging [14]. Uptake of the radiotracers was compared with the biodistribution of free cobalt. In tumor-bearing mice, free cobalt distributed primarily to the liver, kidneys, and heart while the 55Co-peptides were observed to clear through the kidneys. Unexpectedly, uptake in the tumors was highest for free cobalt, though it is unclear whether this is due to Ca2+ mimetic properties of Co or higher blood activity seen with free cobalt than the labeled peptides. The group had previously investigated [64Cu]Cu-NO2A-L19K-FDNB which showed higher tumor uptake than the cobalt-labeled peptides [141], which indicates that the afﬁnity of this peptide for targeting VEGF was negatively affected by radiolabeling with cobalt-55.

Context: A summary of molar activities obtained for the targeting paradigms discussed above is included in Table 3 below. Cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are ideally suited as a matched-pair theranostic for use in both research and clinical environments. A wide range of production pathways are available for cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m with distinct advantages to each method. For use in clinical applications, enriched targets coupled with modern cyclotrons are likely the best path forward since this method can result in high radiochemical purities (>98%). Furthermore, the literature for chelating cobalt-58m was reviewed and results compared with clinically approved and other contemporary radiopharmaceuticals. In many of the applications reported, cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are at least comparable to gallium-68 and lutetium-177 with some studies also reporting superior contrast with cobalt- 55 over gallium-68 and higher cell-killing efﬁciencies with cobalt-58m as compared to lutetium-177. However, despite the favorable results, there have not been any in vivo human trials using cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m in targeted radionuclide therapy and thus further studies are necessary.

Context: Abstract—The possibility of producing 225Ac and 223Ra by irradiation of natural 232Th with medium-energy protons was examined. Thorium foils were irradiated with 90-, 110-, and 135-MeV protons at the accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Troitsk (Moscow oblast). The cumulative production cross sections for 225Ac were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, and for 227Th (223Ra precursor), 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. Based on the experimental data and theoretical calculations, the possible yields of 225Ac and 223Ra in irradiation of thick thorium targets at various accelerators were deter- mined. An efficient procedure was suggested for isolating the products from the irradiated targets: 225Ac, by liquid extraction and extraction chromatography, and 223Ra, by sublimation from a thorium–lanthanum melt followed by thermochromatographic separation in metallic titanium columns and extraction-chromatographic isolation of radium. The procedure allows production of large (units of curies) amounts of radiochemically pure 225Ac and 223Ra, which is promising for wide use of these radionuclides in nuclear medicine.

Context:  Actinium-225 (T1/2 = 10.0 days) is one of the most promising α-emitting radionuclides for therapy of vari- ous tumor diseases [1, 2]. It is also promising to use this radionuclide in generators as a source of the daughter short-lived 213Bi (T1/2 = 46 min). Various methods for 225Ac production are known [3]. Usually this radionuclide is isolated from products of 233U decay following the scheme 233U (T1/2 = 1.6 × 105 years) → 229Th (T1/2 = 7340 years) → 225Ra (T1/2 = 14.8 days) → 225Ac [4, 5]. Difficult availability of the starting 233U restricts the possibility of producing large amounts of 225Ac. 229Th, from which 225Ac is di- rectly isolated, can also be produced from 230Th (T1/2 = 75 400 years) by irradiation with fast neutrons or γ-quanta [6]. The starting 230Th is a member of the 238U radioactive series, and its content is about 20 g per ton of uranium, i.e., this material is also difficultly avail- able.

The starting 226Ra is also difficultly available. In addition, radium targets of relatively large mass are dangerous in handling, which gives rise to serious problems in their wide application, especially in cases when radium regeneration from the irradiated targets is required. Another radionuclide promising for medicine is 223Ra (T1/2 = 11.4 days). It is directly used for therapy of bone tumor diseases [12]. It can also serve as a source of 211Pb (T1/2 = 36 min) in generators [13]. The common route to small amounts of 223Ra is its isolation from 235U decay products. Large amounts of 223Ra can be produced by irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reac- tor, followed by chemical isolation of the formed 227Ac (T1/2 = 21.8 years) decaying into 227Th (T1/2 = 18.7 days) and then into 223Ra.

In addition, radium targets of relatively large mass are dangerous in handling, which gives rise to serious problems in their wide application, especially in cases when radium regeneration from the irradiated targets is required. Another radionuclide promising for medicine is 223Ra (T1/2 = 11.4 days). It is directly used for therapy of bone tumor diseases [12]. It can also serve as a source of 211Pb (T1/2 = 36 min) in generators [13]. The common route to small amounts of 223Ra is its isolation from 235U decay products. Large amounts of 223Ra can be produced by irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reac- tor, followed by chemical isolation of the formed 227Ac (T1/2 = 21.8 years) decaying into 227Th (T1/2 = 18.7 days) and then into 223Ra. As already noted, irra- diation and processing of a radium target involve seri- ous problems.

Context: Fig. 1. Scheme of 225Ac isolation from irradiated thorium target. We believe that the most promising route of pro- duction of 225Ac, 223Ra, and some other important ra- dionuclides is irradiation of natural 232Th targets with medium-energy protons, followed by product isolation. In the early 1960s, Lefort et al. experimentally meas- ured the production cross sections of 225Ac and 223Ra from 232Th at a proton energy of 150 MeV [14], and Gauvin measured the 225Ac production cross sections at proton energies in the range 43–115 MeV [15]. Also, 232Th was irradiated with the aim of 225Ac pro- duction with 660-MeV protons at an accelerator in Dubna [16] and with 600-MeV protons at an accelera- tor in CERN [17]. The possibility of producing 225Ac from thorium by its irradiation with protons of the en- ergy lower than 40 MeV was noted recently [18], but no experimental data confirming this assumption were presented. On the whole, only limited information is available on optimization of production of various ra- dionuclides from a thorium target and on radiochemi- cal procedures for isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from irradiated Th and on their purification to remove other radionuclides. Up to now, 225Ac and 223Ra were not actually produced by this procedure. The major goal of this study was measuring the 225Ac and 223Ra production cross sections in reactions of Th with 90–135-MeV protons with the aim to opti- mize the conditions for production of large amounts of these radionuclides on the proton beam of the Moscow Meson Factory [Institute for Nuclear Research (INR), Russian Academy of Sciences, Troitsk]. In the course of our study, we developed efficient radiochemical procedures for isolating Ac and Ra in the radiochemi- cally pure state. It can be expected that wide use of 225Ac and 223Ra in medicine will allow in the future cardinal solution of the problem of treating many tu- mor diseases. Th irradiation. In irradiation experiments we used 10 × 10 mm2 pieces of 5-μm-thick Th metal foil. The foils were irradiated with a beam of accelerated pro- tons of energy 128, 143, and 158 MeV at the linear accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Rus- sian Academy of Sciences [19], at a beam current of approximately 5 μA. In the course of irradiation, tho- rium foils wrapped in aluminum foil were intensely cooled with a water flow. To decrease the proton en- ergy to 90, 110, and 135 MeV, graphite absorbers were arranged before the target. The accuracy in the proton energy determination was approximately ±2.5 MeV. The uncertainty was determined by the accelerator pa- rameters and by proton scattering as a result of their absorption by graphite and cooling water. The proton flux was monitored with Al and Cu foils by production of 22Na and 62Zn, respectively, whose production cross sections are known [20]. The foils after irradiation were withdrawn and sub- jected to γ-ray spectrometric analysis using a spec- trometer equipped with a HPGe detector with a beryl- lium window (Canberra GR 3818). 225Ac isolation.

Irradiated Th metal foils were dissolved in concentrated HNO3, the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 3–8 M HNO3, and Th was extracted with two portions of 1–5 M TBP or 0.1–0.5 M TOPO solution in toluene [21]. After the Th extraction, the aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, concentrated HClO4 was added, and the solu- tion was evaporated to dryness to remove Ru isotopes. For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatogra- phy in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-di- (TRU- isobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) [11, 22]. After washing the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, Ac was eluted with the next 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, and the solu- tion was collected. For complete purification of Ac, the extraction chromatography was performed twice. The radiochemical purity of 225Ac was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry with a semiconductor PIPS detector (Canberra). 223Ra isolation. Chemical isolation of Ra from irra- diated metallic Th was performed by a gas-chemical method. For this purpose, a piece of irradiated thorium foil (3 mg) together with metallic La (280 mg) was placed in a crucible of metallic Zr. Addition of La (Тm = 918°С) leads to formation of a melt with Th (for Th, Тm = 1755°С), and in the liquid metal diffusion and, correspondingly, release of the sublimed micro- elements are considerably faster than in solid Th. The crucible was heated for 1 h in succession at 970, 1040, 1130, 1190, 1270°С in a stream of helium purified with a titanium getter (the heating temperature was determined with an accuracy of ±15°С). Radium and other radionuclides were deposited at the furnace out- let on tantalum collectors in the form of foils which were replaced when changing the heating temperature. In another experiment (Fig. 2), an irradiated tho- rium sample with metallic La was heated for 1 h at 1200 ± 15°С, and the released products were trans- ferred with a helium stream into a thermochroma- tographic column (quartz tube lined with titanium foil from the inside); the sublimed elements were deposited on the Ti surface in different temperature zones. After the heating completion, the titanium foil serving as collector for sublimed products was cut into pieces (corresponding to temperature zones), and the γ-ray spectrum of each piece of the collector was measured. After that, the piece of the collector with the deposited Ra, Ba, and Sr was subjected to further purification by

Thus, the experimentally measured production cross sections are cumulative, and they cannot be accurate, because the production cross sections of the parent 225Th, 225Ra, 229Pa, and 225Ra were not determined sufficiently reliably. Never- theless, these cumulative cross sections allow estima- tion of 225Ac yields in irradiation of targets in different ranges of proton energy. The 225Ac production cross sections that we calcu- lated from γ-ray spectrometric data are plotted in Fig. 4 in comparison with the theoretical values obtained us- ing different models: ALICE (ALICE-IPPE version) and cascade evaporation (СЕF). For the proton ener- gies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, the experimental cross sections were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, respectively. Figure 4 also shows the experimental data obtained previously [14, 15]. Our experimental data lie between the theoretical data calculated by different models and better agree with the previous experimental data reported in [14], rather than in [15]. Figure 5 shows the 225Ac yields that we calculated for a thorium target in relation to its thickness and ini- tial (“inlet”) energy of protons incident on the thick target (the energy of protons leaving the target was taken equal to 40 MeV; below this energy, the 225Ac yield is extremely low).

As can be seen, it is more appropriate to produce 225Ac at proton energies exceeding 100 MeV. On the basis of the available experimental and theo- retical data (Table 2), we calculated the amounts of 225Ac that can be produced in one 10-day irradiation run at various accelerators: in INR, Brookhaven Na- tional Laboratory (USA), Los Alamos National Labo- ratory (USA), TRIUMF (Canada), and Arronax (France). The real beam current attainable at these in- stallations on thorium targets, taking into account the possibilities of their cooling, is given. The proton en- ergy decreases on passing through inlet windows, cool- ing water layer, and target shell, so the energy of pro- tons incident on the target (“inlet” energy) is usually lower by 5–15 MeV than the initial accelerated proton energy. Some installations use multilayer targets for better cooling, and certain energy loss is observed in water gaps between the target layers and in the shells (this loss was taken equal to 10%). The chemical yield was taken equal to 90%. The target was kept after irra- diation for 10 days in the case of 225Ac and 16 days in the case of 223Ra (the best time for accumulation from 227Th). As can be seen, the Ac yield monotonically in- creases with an increase in the proton energy, and effi- cient production is possible by irradiation of a metallic Th target with accelerated protons of the energy ex- ceeding 100 MeV. 227Th production cross sections and 223Ra yields. Theoretical calculations show that the major pathway of 223Ra formation is via α-decay of 227Th (Т1/2 = 18.7 days) produced by the (p,p5n) reaction and via

Context: β+-decay of 227Pa produced by the (p,6n) reaction. The contributions of the direct 223Ra production and its pro- duction via 223Fr and 223Rn are insignificant (<1%). The experimental cumulative production cross- sections of 227Th, determined in this study for proton energies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, are 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. In Fig. 6, these data are given in comparison with the results of calculations by two versions of ALICE code and by the СЕF model. The theoretical and experimental values are in reason- able agreement. Figure 7 shows the calculated 223Ra yields in irra- diation of a thorium target (irradiation for 10 days, cooling for 16 days, an optimal dime for the decay of 227Th into 223Ra).

Table 2. It is appropriate to produce 223Ra, like 225Ac, at accelerators with the energy exceeding 100 MeV and high beam current. Chemical isolation of Ac. The γ-ray spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of more than 80 radio- active isotopes of various elements in products of Th irradiation. Along with the desired 225Ac and 223Ra, other radionuclides are formed by fusion and spallation reactions and by the subsequent decay of the products of these reactions: 224Ra (Т1/2 = 3.7 days), 225Ra (14.8 days), 226Ac (29 h), 227Ac (21.8 years), 227Th (18.7 days), 228Th (1.9 years), 231Th (25.5 h), 228Pa (22 h), 229Pa (1.4 days), 230Pa (17.4 days), 232Pa (1.3 days), 233Pa (27 days), and 230U (20.8 days). It is important that irradiation of metallic Th is not ac- companied by formation of significant amounts of 222Rn (3.8 days), giving rise to serious technical prob- lems in the isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from radium sources. Also, some fission products were detected in amounts comparable (in activity) with those of the de- Fig. 8. Extraction-chromatographic separation of Ac from other elements using a sorbent based on isobutylcarbamoyl phosphine oxide: (1) 224Ac, (2) 105Ru, (3) 131I, (4) 136Cs, (5) 140Ba/La, and (6) 141Ce. sired radionuclides: 111Ag (7.5 days), 103Ru (39.3 days), 106Ru (372 days), 131I (8.0 days), 126Sb (12.4 days), 127Sb (3.9 days), 125Sn (9.6 days), 123Sn (129 days), 124Sb (60.3 days), 127Xe (36.4 days), 115mCd (44.6 days), 129mTe (33.6 days), 136Cs 13.2 days), 95Zr (64.0 days), 95Nb (35.0 days), 93Y (10 h), 140Ba (12.8 days), 99Mo (66 h), 141Ce (32.5 days), 148mPm (41.3 days), 147Nd (11.0 days), etc. (several hundreds of peaks in the γ-ray spectra). The relative activity of 225Ac in the mixture formed was as low as ~1%, and that of 223Ra, several percents. Thus, isolation of radiochemically pure 225Ac from a complex mixture of radionuclides is a complex prob- lem. The process for 225Ac isolation from solution con- sisted of extraction and extraction-chromatographic steps. In liquid extraction, macroamounts of Th, and also Pa, Zr (>90%), I (>75%), and Nb (35–40%) pass to the organic phase, whereas the other elements, in- cluding Ac and Ra, remain in the aqueous phase. The results of extraction-chromatographic separa- tion of a number of elements in the carrier-free state are shown in Fig. 8. Washing of the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3 eliminates such interfering radionuclides as 136Cs, 105Ru, 140Ba, and 131I. The Ac fraction was eluted in the next 15 ml of the acid, whereas such in- terfering radionuclides as 141Ce and 140La remained on the column. We found that 225Ac was fully purified when the extraction chromatography was performed twice. Figure 3b shows the γ-ray spectrum of the iso- lated Ac fraction. The purity of the product obtained by irradiation of Th with 110-MeV protons and puri- fied using the above-described chemical procedure is characterized by the following parameters: chemical yield of 225Ac no less than 90%; radionuclidic purity of

Chemical isolation of Ra. Radium-223 was iso- lated by a gas-chemical method used previously for isolating certain actinide, lanthanide, and alkaline- earth elements in the carrier-free form [23, 24]. The method is based on the fact that Ra in the metallic state is considerably more volatile than Th and a number of other interfering elements (Ac, Pa, La, Pm, Ce, Nd, Be, Cr, Zr, Mo, Nb, Tc, Sn, Ag, Ru, Rh). The addition of metallic La is extremely important. Thorium placed in a zirconium crucible together with metallic La dis- solved in liquid La in the course of heating, which en- sured fast diffusion of the microelements being iso- lated in the liquid metal and high degree of sublima- tion of Ra isotopes. The presence of metallic La also stabilizes the metallic state of nonvolatile elements (actinides, lanthanides, and also Sn) which could sub- lime at the experiment temperature in the form of vola- tile lower oxides from vessels made of Ti and Zr [25]. Lanthanum also binds into nonvolatile compounds Sb and Te, which under other conditions readily sublime at approximately 1200°С [26]. Special experiments showed that without metallic La the Ra sublimation yield decreased and some other interfering elements sublime, which makes the subsequent thermochroma- tographic separation less efficient. Heating of the irradiated metallic Th in the pres- ence of La for 2 h at 1200°С ensured release of more than 99% of radium isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, 225Ra), of Sr and Ba isotopes, and also of I, Br, Cd, and Cs, which are highly volatile in the elementary state. The ele- ments that exhibit low volatility in the elementary state (Ac, Th, Pa, U, Ru, Sn, Zr, Nb, Y, Mo, Ce, Pm, Nd), and also Sb and Te did not sublime and fully remained in the crucible. Figure 9 shows the temperature de- pendence of the release of various elements from a melt with La (the points characterize stepwise heating of the same sample at successively increasing tempera- tures, for 1 h at each temperature). The relatively low degree of the release of I can be accounted for by low rate of diffusion of large iodide ion in a Th–La melt.

The deposition temperature of Ra, Ba, and Sr (maxi- mum of the thermochromatographic peak) under these conditions was 800 ± 30; that of Be, ≥1170; that of

Apparently, Ra, Ba, Sr, Be, Cs, and Cd are transported along the thermochromatographic column in the ele- mentary state, whereas I and Br form compounds with Ti. As can be seen, by depositing the sublimed ele- ments on the Ti collector in the temperature range 1100–600°С (the range is refined depending on the isolation conditions), it is possible to obtain a fraction of Ra containing only Ва and Sr impurities. The subsequent extraction-chromatographic purifi- cation of this fraction allows us to obtain a fraction of pure Ra containing 223Ra with impurities of 225Ra and 224Ra (Fig. 3c).

Context:  Cadmium-109 is used for fabricating reference ion- izing radiation sources. It can be produced by neutron irradiation of silver. In irradiation of the starting material with >98% enrichment for 6 months in the SM reactor with ther- mal neutrons at a flux density of 1 × 1015 n cm–2 s–1, the total yield of all the Cd isotopes is about 50% rela- tive to the initial silver weight; the specific activity of 109Cd is 4–4.2 Ci g–1. The production of the desired radionuclide is accompanied by the production of a significant amount of 110mAg. The subsequent radio- chemical processing of the irradiated sample is per- formed to remove 110mAg from 109Cd, obtain the re- quired chemical form of the product, and regenerate expensive 107Ag for the repeated irradiation. The 110mAg/109Cd activity ratio in the final product should not exceed 3 × 10–4%. Extensive experimental data are available on the separation of Ag and Cd by ion exchange, extraction, and selective precipitation of Ag [1, 2]. The over- whelming majority of methods are methods of analyti- cal chemistry, unsuitable for operation with gram amounts of Ag and Cd in hot cells under the conditions of remote control. Only the precipitation methods based on precipitation of poorly soluble silver halides or of Ag metal after the silver reduction are an excep- tion. We believe that the precipitation of Ag metal, which is a compact readily settling powder that can be readily washed, is the easiest in implementation. This method was used for isolation and purification of 109Cd [3]; silver was precipitated from 0.1–2 M HNO3 in the presence of NaNO3 on SKN carbon sorbent. At equal initial activity of 109Cd and 110mAg, the Cd/Ag separa- tion factor was approximately 500–800. Final purifica- tion of Cd to remove Ag was performed by isotope dilution of Ag, followed by the AgCl precipitation. In contrast to [3], in numerous procedures for re- covering Ag from wastes the reduction, as a rule, is performed in weakly alkaline or ammonia solutions, because specifically in these media it is most complete [4]. This study was aimed at developing a procedure for Cd purification to remove Ag in one process cycle by reduction and precipitation of Ag from ammonia solutions, followed by the Cd concentration in the form convenient for the subsequent preparation of the 109Cd product (hydrochloric acid solution with preset HCl concentration). We chose as reductant hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS), which does not react with Cd. The precipitated Ag metal is the ready starting product for fabricating targets. Then, Cd is precipitated from the mother liquor in the form of basic cadmium carbonate, which is then readily dissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this study, we determined the conditions for the most complete reduction of Ag and precipitation of basic cadmium carbonate from ammonia solutions.

Context: As seen from Eq. (1), the Ag and HAS ions react in the 2 : 1 molar ratio. For the successful removal of Ag from Cd, it is important to know at what excess of HAS the residual concentration of Ag in the mother liquor will be the lowest. Figure 1 shows the results of experiments on the influence of the HAS/Ag molar ratio on the degree of reduction (precipitation) of Ag in an ammonia buffer solution at рН 10. As seen from Fig. 1, at HAS/Ag = 0.5, i.e., at a stoichiometric amount of HAS, 0.014% of Ag remains in the mother liquor, which corresponds to a decrease in the Ag concentration by a factor of 7.1 × 103. At HAS/Ag ≥ 1, the Ag concentration decreases by a factor of 1 × 105. Influence of рН on the Completeness of the Ag Reduction Because the Ag reduction is performed in an am- monia solution, Ag and Cd occur in the form of am- mine complexes. Therefore, it is hardly probable that an increase in the ammonia concentration and hence in pH will influence the completeness of the Ag reduc- tion. On the other hand, determination of the lower pH limit is very important for performing the process effi- ciently. HAS contains 1 mol of sulfuric acid per mole of the salt. According to Eq. (1), the Ag reduction is accom- panied by the formation of 2 mol of hydrogen ions from 1 mol of HAS. Apparently, the buffer capacity of the initial ammonia solution should exceed the sum of the concentrations of hydrogen ions released in the reaction of silver with HAS and introduced with HAS.

The mass concentration of Ag and Cd was 4–10 mg mL–1. A preset amount of HAS was added to the solution, and the solution was mixed and allowed to stand for 24 h. The mother liquor was separated from the Ag precipitate on a green ribbon paper filter, the precipitate was washed with distilled water, and the wash waters were combined with the mother liquor. The precipitate was dissolved in 4 M HNO3. The content of Cd and Ag in the combined mother liquor and in the solution obtained after dis- solving the Ag precipitate was determined using radio- active tracers. To precipitate basic cadmium carbonate, moist cad- mium nitrate spiked with 109Cd was dissolved in an ammonia buffer solution of the preset composition. The mass concentration of Cd was 4–10 mg mL–1. To this solution, we added a K2CO3 solution to a concen- tration of 0.3 N, mixed, and allowed to stand for 4–6 h. The mother liquor was separated from the precipitate on a green ribbon filter, the precipitate was washed with distilled water, and the wash waters were com- bined with the mother liquor. The Cd content in the combined mother liquor and in the solution obtained after dissolving the precipitate of basic cadmium car- bonate was determined with the radioactive tracer. The activity of 109Cd and concomitant γ-emitting impurities (110mAg, 108mAg) was determined according to [5] on a γ-ray spectrometric installation with a DGDK-150V semiconductor germanium–lithium de- tector [6]. The activity of these radionuclides was de- termined from the results of measuring the counting rate (intensity) in the main peaks of total photon ab- sorption in the detector at the following energies, keV: 109Cd 88; 110mAg 657, 884, 937; 108mAg 434, 723.

Context: Figure 3 shows the dependence of the degree of the CdCO3 precipitation on the NH4OH concentration at different NH4NO3 concentrations. The concentrations of potassium and cadmium carbonates in all the ex- periments were constant and equal to 0.3 and 0.1 M, respectively. As can be seen, at an NH4NO3 concentra- tion of 0–0.6 M the ammonia concentration should not exceed 0.8 M to ensure no less than 95% precipitation of Cd. Thus, the procedure described in this study allows efficient separation of 109Cd from 110mAg in one proc- ess cycle with quantitative isolation of purified 109Cd.

Context: To take full benefit of excitation function and to avoid the formation of the radionuclidic impurities, the proton entrance energy should be 14 MeV.18,19 The physical thickness of the silver layer is chosen in such way that for a given beam/target angle geometry the particle exit energy should be 5 MeV. According to SRIM code (The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter);25 the thickness has to be 352 µm for 90° geometry. To minimize the thickness of the silver layer, a 6° geometry is preferred, in which case a 35 µm layer is recommended. Silver targets are prepared by DC-CCE (constant current electrolysis) of the metal from alkaline plating solutions. An electrolysis solution is a volume of about 450 ml and a composition of 5.1 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.1 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3, while the current between the electrodes is adjusted to 0.05 A. The silver electroplating was performed in constant current. In 2 hours, a silver target of 36.75 mg.cm–2 thickness is prepared. Prior to the silver plating and to ensure a good adhesion, copper plate was cleaned using sandpaper of 1000 grade followed by rinsing copper plate with deionized water. Non-reactive plating vessels are hollow Perspex cylinders (diameter 6 cm, height 20 cm) fitted with an axial Pt anode wire mounted at the bottom by means of a tube-end fitting with perforated septum.

This which has provided useful radionuclide can probably be used for inhibition of liver cancerous cells,12,13 as well as for tissue imaging with computed SPECT (single photon tomography).14 Additionally, to investigate the ecosystem.15 emission it can be used The production of 109Cd with a proton beam can be performed by reactions: In+p,16 that needs an energy of about 96 MeV, Ag+d17 with energy 13.4 MeV and Ag+p,18,19 with an energy range between 14 and 9 MeV. Cyclotron is ideal for this work. Accelerator production of 109Cd is largely achieved via nuclear reactions 109Ag(p,n)109Cd and 109Ag(d,2n)109Cd which are well suited for medium to low-energy cyclotrons. Our centre in Karaj employs a Cyclone-30 (IBA, Belgium). Solid targetry systems on these accelerators are made of pure copper backing onto which target materials are electrodeposited. It is noted that silver electrodeposits prepared from nitrate solutions, free of any organic or inorganic additive, are not smooth or compact, regardless of plating condition used. They consist of grains growing independently of each other and under given plating conditions may degenerate as dendrites.20 Since most of the work directed at replacing cyanide in silver plating 0236–5731/USD 20.00 © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest

Context:  Four symmetrical windows (22.36 or 11.69 cm2) on the vertical side wall allow up to four copper targets backing positioning. Each slot is sealed by an O-ring fitted window. The geometrical shape of the slot determines the actual target electrodeposition area. The liquid-tight sealing of the windows is realized by stainless steel mechanical pestles mounted on a PVC ring surrounding plating vessel and by pressing the copper backing against O-ring seal. An external PVC ring is fitted with four supporting pins to hold a motor-stirrer combination in position. The stirrer is a hollow perforated POM cylinder mounted on the axis of a DC motor and surrounding the platinum anode. The stirrer rotation speed is set at 600 rpm; during the process, its rotating direction is reversed after 8 seconds improving deposit homogeneity. To keep the desired temperature at a preset level, a heater (a series of six isolated 1 Ω/W resistors, through which an appropriate DC-current is forced (1.1 A, 40 °C up to 1.8 A, 60 °C) is circularly mounted at the bottom of the vessel. An insulated sensor, introduced through the stirrer support-plate, temperature. As monitors electrolysis to depletion requires long-time (up to 24 hours) plating, evaporation of plating solution occurs. To maintain a constant liquid volume (450 ml), a conductivity glass/graphite sensor monitors the solution level and actuates a peristaltic pump at the required rate, supplying distilled water to compensate evaporation losses. The rack-mounted home-made electronics includes a motor/stirrer control, an adjustable DC voltage generator card and four V/I converters coupled to current boosters.

Context:  Since large amount of free cyanide in the bath forms a sedimentary layer on the Ag electrodeposition and consequently reduces the current efficiency, adjusting the quantity of free cyanide in the bath is important.26 On the other hand, less amount of free cyanide reduces the bath conductivity. Hence, the bath compounds should be optimized. According to some publications on concentrations of silver in the bath,21–26 a bath with 10.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 7 g.l–1 KCN and 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 was prepared. The data provided in Table 1 denote a poor current efficiency at high current density but also formation of chalk-white sediment on the Ag deposit. low Because in temperature, high current density and high free hydroxide,27 while application of a very low current density results in a rather poor quality of the deposit, and a very high current density reduces the over voltage of hydrogen and decreases the quality and the current efficiency.28 Hence, an optimal value was expected and investigated.

Context:  The current efficiency was determined at different current densities using DC current at room temperature (Table 1). An optimum DC current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 should be applied. Consequently, further experiments were carried out while using current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2, and changes were applied to the concentrations of bath compounds which consist of 8.5 g.l–1 AgCN, 8.5 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3. After changing the concentrations of the bath, the influence of acidity on current efficiency was concerned in further the experiments. These alternations had stopped undesired production of chalk-white sediment on the surface.

Context:  Adjusting the bath acidity is important for the effect of bath efficiency and coating physical properties. A large reduction on acidity causes hydrogen reduction and simultaneously sediment of the basis salts on cathode. After preparing the silver bath (while the pH of bath was about 11) for studying the effects of solution the acidity was acidity on electroplating quality, changed from 8.5 to 13. It is clear that the higher current efficiency and the better electrodeposited layers are available in lower acidity than it is in comparison to electrodeposited layers by higher acidity bath (Table 2).

Context: Silver is a relatively noble metal; most metals being less noble than silver form immersion deposits on the surface. This tends to happen even when the base metal enters the silver solution hot or live, that is, with a voltage already applied. The inevitable result of this phenomenon is poor adhesion of subsequent deposits. To minimize this effect, it is essential to employ a silver strike coating prior to the main deposit.21,24 In this work experiments were carried out on adhesion with and without strike coating. It was concluded that if the plating were carried out very rapidly, a good adhesion would be obtained in all electroplated targets without the need for strike coating. Embrittlement of metals has been recognized for many years but, as two authors have pointed out, some other defects in electrodeposits, such as blistering, cracking, gas pits, peeling off and poor adhesion, may also be related to hydrogen in ways not yet identified.26 Plating on a dietary or greasy surface inevitably leads to blistering or peeling of deposit. Cathodic cleaning in either acid or alkaline solutions provides large quantities of hydrogen for absorption.26 In all experiments, the substrate surface was cleaned with sandpaper of 1000 grade and immersed in the nitric acid bath of 0.3M. Then the surface was washed by water and its oil contaminators were removed by a mixture of the alkali cleaning powders. Finally, the surface was washed with acetone.

It was concluded that if the plating were carried out very rapidly, a good adhesion would be obtained in all electroplated targets without the need for strike coating. Embrittlement of metals has been recognized for many years but, as two authors have pointed out, some other defects in electrodeposits, such as blistering, cracking, gas pits, peeling off and poor adhesion, may also be related to hydrogen in ways not yet identified.26 Plating on a dietary or greasy surface inevitably leads to blistering or peeling of deposit. Cathodic cleaning in either acid or alkaline solutions provides large quantities of hydrogen for absorption.26 In all experiments, the substrate surface was cleaned with sandpaper of 1000 grade and immersed in the nitric acid bath of 0.3M. Then the surface was washed by water and its oil contaminators were removed by a mixture of the alkali cleaning powders. Finally, the surface was washed with acetone.

Context: Silver is a relatively noble metal; most metals being less noble than silver form immersion deposits on the surface. This tends to happen even when the base metal enters the silver solution hot or live, that is, with a voltage already applied. The inevitable result of this phenomenon is poor adhesion of subsequent deposits. To minimize this effect, it is essential to employ a silver strike coating prior to the main deposit.21,24 In this work experiments were carried out on adhesion with and without strike coating. It was concluded that if the plating were carried out very rapidly, a good adhesion would be obtained in all electroplated targets without the need for strike coating.

Context:  After finding the most economic and qualitative bath concentrations, some experiments were carried out for 2 to 10 hours for the solution that contained 5.16 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.16 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3 at 24 °C. When the best quality and current efficiency was obtained in these experiments at room temperature and without adding any additives, a suitable molarity of the bath composition produced the current efficiency of 100% (Table 5). To estimate the quality of the electroplated silver targets some criteria had to be taken into account, such as homogeneity, morphology, visual appearance of the silver layer and thermal shock test. The homogeneity of the silver layer is important as it may seriously affect the production rate of 109Ca. This was determined by measuring the thickness of several parts of the layer by a micrometer and calculation of the standard deviation of the data.

Context: The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The evaluation of quality of the layers was achieved by comparison of the photomicrographs in terms of size and form of the Ag nuclei and the extent to which they overlapped each other. The smaller, more spherical and the more overlapping nuclei were considered to be a good plating quality. The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water. Observation of neither crack formation nor peeling off of the silver layers indicated a good adhesion for the purpose. SEM photomicrograph showed that the granulometry of electroplated targets with current density of 8.54–12.82 mA.cm–2 were not as desired (Figs 1a and 1b). Hence, current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 was chosen and the SEM photomicrograph showed a suitable granulometry (Figs 2 and 3). The SEM photomicrograph of the best electrodeposition of these baths is shown in Fig. 3.

Context: The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The evaluation of quality of the layers was achieved by comparison of the photomicrographs in terms of size and form of the Ag nuclei and the extent to which they overlapped each other. The smaller, more spherical and the more overlapping nuclei were considered to be a good plating quality.

Context:  Abstract—Zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrices were prepared by mixing solutions of zirconium oxychlo- ride, selenous acid, and sodium molybdate in different manners. The elution of the generated 99mTc radioactiv- ity from the obtained zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrices was studied using small chromatographic col- umns of the matrix. 6 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix dried at 50°C, packed in a glass column (1.1 cm i.d.), was eluted by passing 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 and ambient temperature (~25°C). The 99mTc elution yield of 77.1% was obtained. Radionuclidic, radiochemical, and chemical purity of the eluate proved to be suitable for use in medical applications.

Context:  In nuclear medicine, 99mTc is the most frequently used radiotracer because of its suitable physical and nuclear properties. It emits monoenergetic (140 keV) γ-photon suitable for γ-cameras. In addition, its half- life of 6 h is suitable for performing the required tests without exposing the patient to unacceptable radiation dose. Planar cameras are used for bone scanning with 99mTc-MDP, and SPECT cameras are used for cardiac 99mTc-Sestamibi [1–7]. Cyclotron- scanning with produced 99mTc is not practical because of the high cost and short half-life [8–10]. The main source of 99mTc is the β–-decay (87.5%) of 99Mo (T1/2 = 65.94 h). Techne- tium-99m of high purity, suitable for medical applica- tions, is obtained by elution of radioisotope generators based on alumina columns loaded with fission 99Mo of high specific activity [11]. Other sorbents were also tested for preparing 99Mo/99mTc generators, such as silica gel, hydrous zirconium oxide, manganese diox- ide, and hydrous titanium oxide [12]. The main disad- vantage of these generators is the limited adsorption capacity of the base material for 99Mo, which, in turn, requires the use of 99Mo of very high specific activity (of the order of tens thousands Ci g–1), produced from nuclear reactors via fission route. Generation of high amounts of intermediate and long-lived fission product waste as a result of complex multistep separation and purification of fission 99Mo in expensive hot cells with sophisticated equipment and infrastructure are the

Context: main disadvantages of fission 99Mo radioisotope gen- erators [13]. Alternative technologies are required to overcome these drawbacks. These alternative technolo- gies are based on incorporating neutron activation 99Mo of low and medium specific activity (0.3– 3.5 Ci g–1 Mo) into insoluble precipitates of high Mo content such as Ce, Zr, Mg, Ti, Fe, Th, Sn, and Te compounds, which are then used as column matrices [14–28]. Post- and pre-irradiation-formed gels are the two common techniques used for preparing gel genera- tors. Isotope exchange allows overcoming the radiation degradation resulting from irradiation of the prepared gel material and the multistep procedure in pre- and post-irradiation-formed gel techniques, respectively [16, 29]. Solvent extraction of 99mTcO4 – or sublimation of 99mTc2O7 has also been used in some generator sys- tems for extraction of 99mTc from 99Mo of relatively low specific activity, produced by direct neutron acti- vation of molybdenum targets [12]. This study was aimed at preparing 99Mo/99mTc gen- erator based on zirconium selenomolybdate as a col- umn matrix by post-irradiation-formed gel technique.

Context:  Radiometric identification and measurements were made with a multichannel analyzer (MCA) of Inspec- tor 2000 model, Canberra series (the United States), coupled with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) coaxial detector of GX2518 model. A UV-160 A UV-VIS spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was used for deter- mining Zr and Mo. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with an 18 kV diffractometer (D8 Ad- vance, Bruker, the United States) with monochromated CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Elemental analysis was carried out with a BW-1200 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Philips, Netherlands). The morphology was examined with a JSM-6510A field emission scan- ning electron microscope (FESEM) (Japan). The IR spectrum was recorded with an MB157S FT-IR spec- trometer (Bomem, Canada) in the range from 4000 to 400 cm–1 at room temperature. Thermal analysis, in- cluding simultaneous thermal gravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal (DTA) analysis, was carried out with a DTG-60H device (Shimadzu, Japan). Radioactive 99Mo solution. 99Mo was obtained by eluting a 99Mo/99mTc generator with alumina-packed columns (Mon-Tek Generator, Monrol Nuclear Prod- ucts Industry and Trade, Turkey), loaded with 20 GBq on calibration date. Each column was eluted with a 2 M NH3 solution. The 99Mo eluate was passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter to retain any possi- ble alumina particles. The ammonium molybdate-99Mo solution was gently heated to dryness and then redis- solved in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Alternatively, for pre- paring 99Mo/99mTc generators, solutions of fission 99Mo (~100 mCi) in 0.1 M NaOH solution were obtained from the ETRR-II Radioisotope Production Facility (RPF). Then, 99Mo solution was diluted with 1.0 M HCl to the desired pH value. Preparation of zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrix. 0.25 M Mo(VI) solution was prepared by dis- solving 3.025 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O in a small portion of distilled water with the addition of 5 mL of a 99Mo solution along with a few drops of 30% H2O2. The re- sulting sodium molybdate solution was warmed to de- stroy excess H2O2 and then cooled to room tempera- ture before adjusting to pH about 4.5 with 2 M HNO3. The volume of the Mo(VI) solution was completed to 50 mL with distilled H2O. 0.25 M Zr(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 5.062 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O in a small portion of distilled water and then was com- pleted to 62.5 mL, after which it was heated to 60°C and then left to cool to room temperature (~25°C).

Context: 0.2 M Se(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 3.224 g of H2SeO3 in a small portion of distilled water and then was completed to 50 mL. Mixtures with dif- ferent Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios were pre- pared by dropwise addition of the Mo(VI) solution to the stirred Se(IV) solution, followed by dropwise addi- tion of the Zr(IV) solution. Varied volumes of the three solutions were used to obtain different molar ratios. The pH of the solution for preparing the ZSM gel was adjusted to ~5.0 with 2 M Na2CO3. The precipitates formed were digested in the mother solution for 24 h at room temperature before phase separation by centrifu- gation. After separation, the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water until the washing filtrates were free from chloride ions, dried at 50°C for 24 h, and pulverized to the desired particle size. The precipitation yield Y [% 99Mo in the form of Zr(IV) selenomolybdate gel] was radiometrically determined using the formula

Elution of 99mTc from 99Mo-99mTc chroma- tographic columns. Unless otherwise stated, small chromatographic columns consisting of glass burettes of different internal diameter and containing different amounts of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix were used. The columns were conditioned for 99mTc elution by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solutions through the bed matrix and left for 24 h before elution. The columns were eluted 10 times with different flow rates (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mL min–1) over the course of 15 days (shelf life). The time between each two successive elution runs was 23 h. The 99mTc elu- tion yield was determined by comparing the counting rates of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum of the column directly before and after elution, taking the contribution of 99Mo to this peak into account [15]. The elution profiles were drawn for various elution flow rates. pH values of the eluate solutions were de- termined with a pH meter.

Context: The chemical composition, particularly the Mo con- tent of the zirconium selenomolybdate gel, is a signifi- cant factor for its use as a column matrix in preparation of gel-type 99Mo/99mTc radioisotope generators. The chemical composition of the obtained zirconium se- lenomolybdate materials was studied radiometrically by dissolving the gel materials prepared from the ra- dioactive solution of 95Zr, 99Mo, and 75Se in a hot con- centrated HCl solution. The table compiles the data on the Mo(VI) precipitation yield, the corresponding equi- librium pH value, and some properties of the formed zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo products at the given Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios. As can be seen, the precipitation yield of Mo(VI) from the Mo(VI)– Se(IV)–Zr(IV) mixed solutions decreased with increas- ing Se concentration. The Mo content decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrices, ZSM-1 > ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. This means that the selectivity of the positively charged zirconia surface to molybdate and/ or selenite anionic species depends on their concentra- tion in the mixed solution. At low selenite concentra- tions, the molybdate anions show higher affinity for the positively charged zirconia surface than the se- 2– anions appreciably con- lenite anions do. The SeO3 tribute to the ZSM structure at low Mo(VI) content to keep the zirconia surface neutral. The relative content of Zr(IV) in the gel matrices decreased as the initial concentration of Se(IV) in the mixed solutions in- creased: ZSM-1> ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. In addition, the weight loss of the precipitates dried at 150 and 200°C to constant weight decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrix. Therefore, ZSM-1 sample of zirconium selenomolybdate was chosen for characteri- zation (via IR, thermal analysis, XRD, and FESEM) and further preparation and quality control of 99Mo/99mTc generator. The suggested formula of the formed gel matrices may be written as ZrO(OH)+· (HSeO3)1–x(HMoO4)x·nH2O [21].

This means that the selectivity of the positively charged zirconia surface to molybdate and/ or selenite anionic species depends on their concentra- tion in the mixed solution. At low selenite concentra- tions, the molybdate anions show higher affinity for the positively charged zirconia surface than the se- 2– anions appreciably con- lenite anions do. The SeO3 tribute to the ZSM structure at low Mo(VI) content to keep the zirconia surface neutral. The relative content of Zr(IV) in the gel matrices decreased as the initial concentration of Se(IV) in the mixed solutions in- creased: ZSM-1> ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. In addition, the weight loss of the precipitates dried at 150 and 200°C to constant weight decreased with increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrix. Therefore, ZSM-1 sample of zirconium selenomolybdate was chosen for characteri- zation (via IR, thermal analysis, XRD, and FESEM) and further preparation and quality control of 99Mo/99mTc generator. The suggested formula of the formed gel matrices may be written as ZrO(OH)+· (HSeO3)1–x(HMoO4)x·nH2O [21].

Context: gel matrix (ZSM-1) shows the presence of extra water molecules in addition to –OH groups and metal oxides present in the material (Fig. 1). The bands observed at 878 and 722 cm–1 may be due to metal–oxygen bonds, which are manifested in the range 650–1000 cm–1. The band at 1380 cm–1 belongs to bending vibrations of metal-bonded hydroxyl groups. The strong and sharp peak at 1617 cm–1 may be due to HOH bending vibra- tion. The absorption bands at 2900 and 3421 cm–1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of coordinated wa- ter [30, 31]. Figure 2 shows the TG and DTA curves of the zir- conium selenomolybdate gel. The first step in the TG curve between 40–200°C with the weight loss of 11.58% corresponds to the loss of physically adsorbed water and water of crystallization with an endothermic peak in the DTA curve at 125°C. The weight loss in the range 200–440°C was small (2.6%). An endother- mic peak observed at 500.6°C with the weight loss of 11.165% in the range 435–530°C can be assigned to the evaporation of SeO2 and coordinated water and to decomposition of hydroxyl groups. The weight loss in the range 600–900°C was 4.51%. The presence of suit- able amounts of water in the gel material is important to enhance the 99mTc diffusion through the gel material during the elution [32]. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dried zirconium selenomolybdate gel, which shows that it is amorphous. The amorphous structure is much better than the crystalline structure because of more efficient diffusion of the eluent through the amorphous material, increasing the elution yield. The SEM images of the prepared ZSM material at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the gel matrix has a porous basic structure, which makes it good material for diffusion of 99mTc during elution [33].

Context: Elution of 99mTc. Figure 5 shows how the internal diameter of the column and the amount of the matrix influence the 99mTc elution profile. As can be seen, large size of the bed matrix is the major factor influ- encing the 99mTc elution performance. The position of the maximum elution is displaced to higher eluate vol- umes with increasing inside diameter of the column (0.46, 0.6, and 1.1 cm i.d.), i.e., with decreasing height of the zirconium selenomolybdate bed. About 97, 86.2, and 69.9% of the eluted 99mTc radioactivity was eluted with the first 3 mL. The elution yield was found to be 83.3, 81.7, and 76.8% for 0.46, 0.6, and 1.1 cm inside diameter, respectively.

Context: Received June 10, 2005 Abstract(cid:0)The reaction cross sections and the energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deuteron energies (<14 MeV) were determined. The specific features of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets were studied in relation to the gas medium composition. The yield of the desired product increases with an increase in the oxygen content in the course of heat treatment of the targets. A simple (cid:0)dry(cid:2) procedure was developed for isolation of 186Re with a yield no less than 85% and radiochemical purity no worse than 99.99%. A proto- type of a cyclotron target for commercial production of the therapeutical radionuclide 186Re was suggested. PACS numbers: 25.45.-z DOI: 10.1134/S1066362206050171 Radioactive isotopes and ionizing radiation sources are widely used in science, industry, engineering, and medicine. In the past two decades, two major trends were steadily observed on the world market of radio- isotopes: decline in the use of fissile radioactive mate- rials and increase in the production of radionuclides for nuclear medicine [1]. Radionuclide therapy is an actively developing field of nuclear medicine. It has doubtless advantages over other kinds of radiation therapy because of low side effects, minimal damage of normal tissues, and possibility of treating metastases and disseminated tumors. Presently the annual volume of sells of radionu- clides for medicine and of radiopharmaceuticals in the United States (45% of the world market in this field) is about $700 mln. American marketing companies expect that by 2015 the annual volume of sells of radionuclides for medicine will increase to $4.5 bln, primarily due to increased production of therapeutical radioisotopes [1]. In the past 3(cid:0) 4 years, the efforts of the leading research laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL, etc.) are focused on the development of processes for production of certain radionuclides (47Sc, 89Sr, 131I, 153Sm, 186Re, 188Re, 213Bi, 211At), among which 186Re occupies a prominent place. The following factors are responsible for the increased interest

Short path length of the electrons (their maximal energy is 359.2 keV) in living tissues allows destruction of tumors up to 1 mm in diameter. The intrinsic (cid:5)-radiation of the radionuclide (the ener- gy of its main transition, 137.2 keV with an intensity of 9.47%, is approximately the same as that of 99mTc widely used in SPECT, 140.5 keV) is well detected with a commercial scintillation (cid:5)-ray camera and allows efficient monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body. The main goals of this study are as follows: deter- mination of the reaction cross sections and energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deu- teron energies (<14 MeV); study of the specific fea- tures of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets in relation to the gas medium composition; development of a diffusion-thermal procedure for isolating 186Re; mastering of procedures for preparing cyclotron tar- gets from isotopically enriched (186W) powder materi- als; and preliminary radiation and materials-science studies of the new types of the targets.

Context:  The energy dependences of the reaction cross section and yield of 186Re in the energy range 12.84/5.85 MeV (energy threshold of the reaction 3.58 MeV) were measured using foil stacks.

Context:  The discovered phenomenon formally resembles the classical emanation of inert gases from crystalline salts [14] and release of volatile fission products from UO2 [15]. It should be emphasized that such processes are observed only in systems with polymorphism. In par- in the Sn:113mIn system the release of the ticular, 113mIn atoms into the gas phase starts in the tempera- ture range of the (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:5) polymorphous transition (from 453 K), and in the Cd:111In system no (cid:3)volatili- zation(cid:4) of impurities is observed even at temperatures (575(cid:0)585 K) [16]. approaching the melting point Studies of the emanation in the Sn:113mIn system also showed that the release of the impurity atoms into the gas phase depends on the nuclear and physicochemical history of the sample, conditions of foil annealing, and composition of the gas medium [10, 11]. As in the case of the Sn:113mIn system, in the W:186Re system we also observed the release of daughter atoms into the gas phase, taking place only in a combination with a polymorphous transition.

Context:  Cross section of the 186W(d, 2n)186Re reaction as a func- tion of deuteron energy: (1) this study, (2) data of [5], and (3) data of [6]. irradiated W powders, because a polymorphous transi- tion in W was discovered only in finely dispersed samples [17]). Heating of irradiated W above the polymorphous transition point (>1000 K) was accompanied by the release of 186Re into the gas phase; the release of the impurity atoms from the bulk of the metal became more active with an increase in the oxygen content in the medium in the course of heat treatment of the targets. In particular, when the irradiated cyclotron (cid:0)4 torr, the release of (cid:0)5(cid:0)10 targets were annealed at 10 (cid:0)2 torr it did not (cid:0)3(cid:0)10 186Re did not exceed 3%, at 10 exceed 15%, and when the samples (W/C composites) were heated in air, the release increased to 65% (typi- cal value for the majority of our experiments). This fact strongly suggests that, along with the emanation occurring at polymorphous transitions, there is some other process facilitating the release of radioactive microimpurities (in the form of volatile rhenium species ReO3, Re2O7) into the gas phase, e.g., their release in the course of cyclic gas transport reactions of the following type: oxidation of irradiated W metal with atmospheric oxygen (cid:7) sublimation of WO3 with the release of impurity 186Re atoms into the gas phase (cid:7) condensation of WO3 on graphite powder followed by its reduction to metal (cid:7) reoxidation of W metal, etc. We took this separation scheme as a basis for a (cid:3)dry(cid:4) process for 186Re production. Further experi- ments showed that the yield of the desired product can be increased to 85%, with its radiochemical purity being no worse than 99.99%. Radiation materials-science studies of cyclotron targets based on isotopically enriched powdered 186W.

Context: Abstract—The conditions for the oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) and its reduction to Am(V) are shown, and the stability of these forms in a 0.1 M nitric acid model solution of the actinide-lanthanide fraction of high-level waste (HLW) containing isotopes of americium and curium and also praseodymium as a simulant of the behavior of fragmented lanthanides is deﬁ ned. It was found that about 30% of americium in the Am(V) oxidation state of its initial content in a model solution containing a salting-out agent (ammonium nitrate) in an amount of 8 M, passes into the organic phase in one stage of extraction with a 30% solution of tributyl phosphate in Isopar-M. In this case, Cm and Pr are extracted by 80–85%. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Am was about 0.1, of Cm and Pr, about 1, and the separation factor of Am from Cm and Pr was about 10. Thus, the possibility of selective separation of americium from HLW for its subsequent transmutation in fast reactors was demonstrated.

Context: Abstract—The conditions for the oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) and its reduction to Am(V) are shown, and the stability of these forms in a 0.1 M nitric acid model solution of the actinide-lanthanide fraction of high-level waste (HLW) containing isotopes of americium and curium and also praseodymium as a simulant of the behavior of fragmented lanthanides is deﬁ ned. It was found that about 30% of americium in the Am(V) oxidation state of its initial content in a model solution containing a salting-out agent (ammonium nitrate) in an amount of 8 M, passes into the organic phase in one stage of extraction with a 30% solution of tributyl phosphate in Isopar-M. In this case, Cm and Pr are extracted by 80–85%. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Am was about 0.1, of Cm and Pr, about 1, and the separation factor of Am from Cm and Pr was about 10. Thus, the possibility of selective separation of americium from HLW for its subsequent transmutation in fast reactors was demonstrated.

Context: americium into an independent fraction with followed its transmutation in fast neutron reactors [1]. Previously, we proposed a method for separating the actinide–lanthanide fraction from a highly active raﬃ nate during the extraction with TBP in an isoparaﬃ n diluent in the presence of iron nitrate as a salting- out agent [2]. In this case, one of the most important radiochemical problems is the subsequent separation of americium from curium and lanthanides. This separation is necessary for a number of reasons. First, the lanthanides are neutron poisons; some isotopes have a high neutron capture cross section, and their presence in the fuel will inhibit the transmutation of americium [3, 4]. Secondly, the involvement of curium isotopes in a closed nuclear fuel cycle is problematic, since it has a high level of neutron and thermal radiation, which will complicate the manufacture and operation of regenerated homogeneous nuclear fuel or americium targets for its transmutation.

Context: The well-known problem of separating Am, Cm, and lanthanides is caused by the similarity in their chemical properties [5, 6]. TPE and lanthanides are 5f- and 4f-elements, respectively, they are characterized by the ﬁ lling of internal f-orbitals with increasing atomic number, which has little eﬀ ect on the chemical properties that depend mainly on processes in the outer electron shells. In view of this fact, these elements predominantly exist in aqueous solutions in the oxidation state(III). The ionic radii of these cations are also comparable. Americium and curium ions have isostructural analogs in the lanthanide series: r(Nd3+) ≈ r(Am3+), r(Sm3+) ≈ r(Cm3+). Thus, it is diﬃ cult to separate trivalent Am and Cm from lanthanides by adjusting only the size of the coordination sphere of organic ligands. There are several approaches to the separation of Am from Cm and lanthanides, and most of them are based on extraction methods [7, 8]. The key diﬀ erence between these cations is that americium can be oxidized to higher oxidation states Am(V,VI), which changes its extraction behavior [9, 10]. Previously, in our works [11, 12], it was shown that, generating Am(VI) in weakly acidic solutions makes it possible to extract Cm(III) from their mixture using the extractants 1-phenyl-3-methyl- 4-benzoylpyrosolone-5 and trioctylphosphine oxide, while Am(VI), being reduced by the organic phase to Am(V), remains in the aqueous solution. At the same time, the use of these extractants in industrial conditions is challenging. For this reason, it was proposed [13] to use TBP as a reliable and well-tested extractant in the technology to solve the problem of separating Am from Cm. For example, curium was extracted almost quantitatively from solutions containing ≤0.1 M HNO3 and ~8 M NH4NO3 using 30% TBP in Isopar-M, while americium was only partially (≤30%) transferred to the organic phase in the Am(III) form. In this case, a high degree of separation of Cm from Am(V) remaining in the aqueous phase was attained (≥99.9%). At the moment, only a few other works [14–16] are known on the use of TBP as an extractant for separating Am from other transuranium elements or lanthanides. For example, in [14, 16], it was proposed to extract Am(VI) directly from nitric acid solutions without adding a salting-out agent. Reaching high distribution coeﬃ cients can be performed by adjusting the solution acidity. At the initial stage, a decrease in acidity is provided for the eﬃ cient oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI), then its increase it to 1 M relative to HNO3. The separation factor for the Am–Nd pair was about 50; therewith separation of the Am–Np pair did not occur. In [15], it was proposed to use dihydrogen phosphate to bind Nd into a more stable complex compared to Am(VI), which allowed to reach a separation factor of about 120. This work is aimed at studying the extraction of Am in higher oxidation states in weakly acidic solutions— simulants of the actinide–lanthanide fraction of a highly active raﬃ nate, containing americium and curium isotopes and weight amounts of lanthanides (with praseodymium as an example)—using TBP and in the presence of ammonium nitrate as a salting-out agent, not forming insoluble salts with actinides and ﬁ ssion products, including lanthanides.

Context: The elemental composition of SNF from VVER- 1000 reactors with a burnup of 60 GW day/(t U) and holding for 8 years was calculated in [17]. It is shown that the fraction of fragmented lanthanides is 17.2 mg per 1 g of initial uranium. Provided that during the dissolution of SNF it is planned to increase the uranium concentration to 600 g/L, the actinide-lanthanide fraction will account for up to 10.5 g/L of fragmented lanthanides. In this work, we used Pr as a lanthanide simulant, whose absorption bands do not coincide with those of Am(III), Am(V), and Am(VI), which makes it possible to determine the concentrations in solution of both Pr and Am in various oxidation states by the spectrophotometric method. To prepare a model solution of the actinide– lanthanide fraction, the 241Am, 243Am, and 244Сm isotopes were used, the concentrations of which in the initial solution were 2.48 × 10–3, 1.28 × 10–1, and 1.38 × 10–4 g/L, respectively.

To prepare a model solution of the actinide– lanthanide fraction, the 241Am, 243Am, and 244Сm isotopes were used, the concentrations of which in the initial solution were 2.48 × 10–3, 1.28 × 10–1, and 1.38 × 10–4 g/L, respectively. The Pr concentration was 10.5 g/L. Americium was transferred to the highest oxidation states Am(VI) and then to Am(V) according to the following reactions (1) and (2), respectively:

Context: The elemental composition of SNF from VVER- 1000 reactors with a burnup of 60 GW day/(t U) and holding for 8 years was calculated in [17].

Context: Figure 1 shows the spectrum (1) of an initial 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing trivalent Am, Cm, and Pr with the concentrations given in Table 1 as well as spectrum (2) of the same solution after the quantitative oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) according to the procedure described in the experimental part. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the presence in the solution of an almost 100-fold excess of Pr compared to Am (10.5 and 0.13 g/L, respectively) does not aﬀ ect the Am(III) oxidation. We preliminarily studied the extraction of Am(VI) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the pres- ence of 8 M NH4NO3 with 30% TBP in Isopar-M (Table 1). It can be seen from the data in Table 1 that both trivalent Cm and Pr and Am(VI) are extracted to a high degree (up to 95 wt %) under the conditions of the study. The distribution coeﬃ cients (D) of Am(VI), Cm(III), and Pr(III) per an extraction were about 2.5, 3.6, and 1.8, respectively. DAm(VI) = 2.5 correlates with the data of [21], where the maximum distribution co- eﬃ cient was achieved at 4 M HNO3 and the minimum phase contact time, and, however, it was slightly lower than in [16], where 100% TBP was used for extraction. Spectrophotometric method was applied to prove that agent by heating the solution at 90°C for 20 min according to the procedure described in [11]. The eﬃ ciency of this method is usually limited by nitric acid concentrations of no more than 0.5 M [18]. At higher acid concentrations, ammonium persulfate decomposes to form hydrogen peroxide, an eﬀ ective reducing agent 2+ [19]. However, this eﬀ ect, apparently, can be for AmO2 leveled by increasing the concentration of the oxidizing agent to 1.6 M [14], which enabled oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) in 1 M HNO3 by 90 ± 5%. A solution containing Am(V) was obtained by adding 1 μL of a 37% H2O2 solution to 1 mL of an Am(VI) solution in 0.1 M HNO3 previously prepared as described above. The authors of [20] report the possibility of direct preparation of Am(V) in 0.1 M HNO3 by heating to 80–100°C and an ammonium persulfate concentration of 1 M. The completeness of Am(III) oxidation to Am(VI) and its subsequent reduction to Am(V), their behavior during extraction, as well as the concentration of Pr(III) in the solution were monitored by a spectrophotometric method (Unicam UV-300, Unicam Instruments, UK) according to absorption bands at 503 and 814 nm for Am(III), 513 and 717 nm for Am(V), 666 and 996 nm for Am(VI), and 445 and 592 nm for Pr. In extraction experiments, a 30% TBP solution in Isopar-M was used, which was preliminarily contacted for 5 min with an equal volume of a 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing 0.2 M (NH4)2S2O8. Before extraction, a weighed portion of NH4NO3 was introduced into the resulting solutions containing Am(VI) or Am(V), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, to achieve its concentration in the solution of 8 M, as in [13]. Extraction of actinides and Pr was carried out for 1 min at a ratio of aqueous (A) and organic (O) phases of 1 : 5. As we determined earlier [13], 1 min is enough to set thermodynamic equilibrium at the distribution of Am(III) and Cm between a nitric acid solution containing NH- 4NO3 as a salting-out agent and 30% TBP in isopar-M. The phases were brought into contact with each other by shaking the tubes by hand for 1 min. The phases were then centrifuged to separate them for about 1 min at 2000 rpm. After the phases were separated and analyzed. The total concentration of Am and Cm in the used solutions was found by alpha spectrometry (Alpha Analyst, Canberra, USA).

Context:  Am(VI) in organic phase is reduced mainly to Am(V) and partially to Am(III), and after 1 day storage, Am(V) completely transforms into Am(III). However, in some works, contradictions were noted regarding the stability of Am(VI) in the presence of TBP. Thus, the authors of [14, 16] point to the relative stability of Am in the or- ganic phase, while it was stated in [21] that contact with organic phase led to a rapid americium reduction result- ing in a lower D(Am) than expected. Thus, from the data in Table 1, it can be concluded that Am(VI), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, is successfully extracted with 30% TBP in Isopar-M from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of NH4NO3 salting-out agent. Therefore, this approach to the separation of Am(VI) from Cm and lanthanides un- der these conditions is technologically unrealizable.

Context:  Fig. 2. Absorption spectra of Am(V) and Pr(III) in 0.1 M HNO3 before (1) and after (2) adding salting-out agent (8 M NH4NO3). The main problem of using Am(V) for its separation from Cm and REE is its reduction to Am(III), which is well extractable under these conditions. The Am(V) reduction occurs under the action of radiolysis products [22], disproportionation of Am(V) [23], and due to contact with organic phase. Selection of the conditions under which the extraction of Am(V) in TBP will be minimal without replacing TBP with the TODGA extractant, which is not yet available for industrial technology, as was done in [24, 25], will make it possible to achieve the quantitative separation of americium from curium, as well from lanthanides. Thus, an important task for future research is the stabilization of americium in its weakly extractable form Am(V).

Context: 1. OECD-NEA Potential Beneﬁ ts and Impacts of Advanced Nuclear Fuel Cycles with Actinide Partitioning and Transmutation; Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), Paris: OECD, 2011. The extraction of Am(V) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of 8 M NH4NO3 with 30% TBP in Isopar-M was studied. It was preliminarily conﬁ rmed that the addition of the salting-out agent NH4NO3 to the solution does not lead to a change in the oxidation state of Am(V) (Fig. 2). Experiments were conducted in which the Pr content was 1.05 or 10.5 g/L at a constant content of Am(V) and Cm; extraction was performed at a ratio of A : O = 1 : 5. Data of Table 2 show that diﬀ erent Pr content does not lead to a change in the degree of extraction of Am(V) in a one-stage extraction. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Am(V) is found to be about 0.1; americium is extracted in organic phase by no more than 30% of its content in the initial solution, which is consistent with the data of [13]. At the same time, the distribution coeﬃ cients of Pr and Cm are found to be very close, about 1 (Table 2), and the degree of their extraction is 80–85% per extraction cycle. It was noted that the separation factor SFCm/Am is found to be signiﬁ cantly lower than in [13], when it was possible to extract Cm almost completely in organic phase (SFCm/Am was 65). Obviously, this can be explained by the eﬀ ect of more than a hundredfold amount of Pr present in the solution relative to the initial Am content. It should also be taken into account that the concentrations of Am and Cm in the initial solution were several orders of magnitude higher (0.13 and 1.38 × 10–4, respectively) than in [13]. At the same time, it was shown that the separation fac- tor can be increased by using a three-stage extraction at a volume ratio of A : O = 1 : 1, as it was demonstrated for Pr in the absence of TPE (Table 3). In this case, the degree of its extraction reached 98%, even though the total volume of the extractant was 1.6 times less than in the case of one-stage extraction with the ratio A : O = 1 : 5.

Context: It was found that about 30% of Am(V) is extracted with a 30% TBP solution in Isopar-M from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of 8 M NH4NO3 during a one-stage extraction at a volume ratio of A : O = 1 : 5, while Cm and Pr are recovered by more than 80%. Using Pr as an example, it was shown that the replacement of one-stage extraction with a ratio of A : O = 1 : 5 by a three-stage one with a volume ratio of A : O = 1 : 1 makes it possible to quantitatively extract Cm and Pr.

Context: Abstract—The solvent extraction of the 90Y/90Sr pair from carbonate media with mixtures of aromatic dihydroxy compounds and a quaternary ammonium salt—methyltrioctylammonium carbonate (MTOAC)—in toluene and butyl acetate was studied. It was found that MTOAC increases the distribution coeﬃ cients of both the extractant itself and its solvate with yttrium due to the formation of a mixed complex of yttrium and a dihydroxyaromatic ligand with MTOAC. During extraction from alkaline carbonate media in the pH range of 12–13.5 with mixtures of 0.01 M 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 0.015 M MTOAC in butyl acetate or toluene, the distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium exceed 80; the separation factors of the 90Y/90Sr pair under these conditions are more than 105. Dilute solutions of hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric acids can be used for the complete stripping of yttrium. The studied mixtures are chemically stable and do not change the extraction properties upon multiple extraction/stripping cycles. Model experiments on the leaching of yttrium from natural samples showed that the percentage of stable yttrium extraction from sand is 70–80%, while the percentage of yttrium extraction from soil is 50–60%.

Context: The isotope 90Sr, formed during the ﬁ ssion of uranium and plutonium nuclei, together with 137Cs makes the main contribution to the global pollution of water and soil on Earth. Atmospheric nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility of 90Sr brings about its distribution in the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of living beings, where it concentrates in the bones and damages the surrounding tissues. The obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment is complicated by its nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the matrix material, exposure until equilibrium with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid– liquid extraction is widely used for the separation of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is eﬃ ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2]. But in both cases, a preliminary acid digesting of the samples is necessary, which involves the use of toxic and aggressive reagents. We proposed

Context:  Model experiments with natural samples were conducted as follows. A sample of building sand was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and dried in an oven. After that, a sample of sand weighing 1 g was taken. A solution of stable yttrium nitrate was added to the sample in such an amount that its concentration in the ﬁ nal sample was 30 mg/L, everything was thoroughly mixed and dried in an oven, after which 3 g of Na2CO3 and K2CO3 were added to the sample. The resulting mixture was calcined in a muﬄ e for 1 h at 500°C. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the sample was placed in a polypropylene test tube, 50 mL of the leaching agent solution was added to the sample (5 leaching agents were tested in total—H2O/H2O2 (3 : 2), NaHCO3/H2O2, NH4HCO3/H2O2, and (NH4)2CO3/H2O2, (NH4)2CO3). For 2 h, a sample of sand was contacted at stirring with the aqueous phase to transfer yttrium carbonate into the aqueous phase. Then the aqueous phase was separated and sent for extraction with a mixture of 0.01 M 2.3DHN + 0.015 M MTOAC in toluene at a volume ratio of the organic and aqueous phases O : A = 1 : 1 and a contact time of 10 min. Afterwards, the phases were separated by centrifugation. Yttrium was stripped from the organic phase with a 0.05 M HNO3 solution at O : A = 5 : 1, after which the nitric acid aqueous solution was separated by centrifugation. The content of stable yttrium was measured therein by the spectrophotometric method. A soil sample (500 g), taken in a forest belt on the territory of the Leningrad Region, was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and mixed with a radioactive label containing a 90Y/90Sr pair being in radioactive equilibrium with a total activity of 530 Bq (the speciﬁ c activity of the soil was about 1 Bq/g ).

Context: Preliminary experiments showed that all the studied aromatic dihydroxy compounds weakly extract yttrium from alkaline media. The low extraction eﬃ ciency may be due to the washing out of the extractant into the aqueous phase because of the formation of hydrophilic sodium phenolates. According to the literature data [5], 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene has pKa1 = 8.8, pKa2 = 12.6, which indicates its complete transition to the monosodium salt in highly alkaline media. The MTOAC cation generates hydrophobic salts with the phenolate anion and helps to reduce the loss of the extractant with the aqueous phase. Figure 1 shows data on the distribution of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and its salt with MTOAC between the organic and aqueous phases. From the data in Fig. 1, it can be seen that at pH below 11, the addition of MTOAC does not signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ect the distribution of 2,3DHN between the aqueous and organic phases. At pH 13.5, the transition of 2,3DHN from butyl acetate into the aqueous phase decreases from 75 to 3.2% in the presence of MTOAC. Obviously, during the yttrium extraction in a strongly alkaline medium, the anionic complex of 2,3DHN with the metal interacts with the MTOAC cation and passes into the organic phase. It should be noted that the yttrium extraction with dihydroxy compounds sharply increases at pH of aqueous solutions above 11 (see below).

Context: yttrium extraction, was determined by the method of isomolar series (Fig. 2). It can be seen that a 1.5- fold excess of MTOAC with respect to 2,3DHN is optimal, which suggests the formation of a solvate of the composition [Y(2,3DHN)2(MTOAC)3] [6]. The existence of a complex of this composition is conﬁ rmed by the MS-ESI(–) data: in addition to the 2,3DHN monoanion (m/z = 159.0448), there is a signal with m/z = 404.8723 of the [Y(2,3DHN)2]– monoanion. The MS- ESI(–) spectra contain signals from anionic complexes, which, in addition to yttrium and 2,3DHN, include carbonate and hydroxyl groups and water molecules. Compared to pure 2,3DHN and MTOAC, their synergistic mixture extracts yttrium with distribution coeﬃ cients approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher: for 0.005 M MTOAC in PhMe, DY = 0.47, for 0.005 М 2,3DHN DY = 2.5 × 10–5, and for their mixture DY = 32 (Fig. 2). As already noted, the maximum extraction of yttrium by mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with MTOAC is detected at pH above 11. We found that the speciﬁ c form of distribution coeﬃ cient curve for yttrium vs. pH of the aqueous phase is determined by the type of dihydroxy compound and the type of organic solvent (Fig. 3). The most eﬀ ective extractant in both solvents is 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. The lowest distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium, regardless of the type of solvent, are demonstrated by 4-tert-butylpyrocatechol. Its unsubstituted analog, pyrocatechol, extracts yttrium well only into toluene solutions. This may be due to steric factors, since the properties of phenolic groups in these extractants are very similar. High distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium were found in a water-soluble chelating agent, alizarin, giving a hydrophobic complex with MTOAC, which is concentrated in the organic phase. A solution of alizarin in butyl acetate upon contact with an aqueous phase with a pH below 12.5 forms a third phase. The possibility of eﬃ cient separation of yttrium and strontium was demonstrated by the example of 2,3DHN, the most eﬃ cient of the studied extractants (Fig. 4). The data in Fig. 4 show that at pH > 12, Y/Sr pair separation factors exceed 105 in both toluene and butyl acetate. Such a high selectivity is unattainable in the extraction of strontium with crown ethers [1] or yttrium with alkyl phosphoric acids [2] from nitric acid solutions. Small diﬀ erences in the behavior of stable and radioactive isotopes are most likely associated with a high error in determining the low activities of 90Sr and 90Y in saline solutions. An additional advantage of the studied extraction systems is the simplicity of yttrium stripping with dilute acid solutions.

Context: yttrium extraction, was determined by the method of isomolar series (Fig. 2). It can be seen that a 1.5- fold excess of MTOAC with respect to 2,3DHN is optimal, which suggests the formation of a solvate of the composition [Y(2,3DHN)2(MTOAC)3] [6]. The existence of a complex of this composition is conﬁ rmed by the MS-ESI(–) data: in addition to the 2,3DHN monoanion (m/z = 159.0448), there is a signal with m/z = 404.8723 of the [Y(2,3DHN)2]– monoanion. The MS- ESI(–) spectra contain signals from anionic complexes, which, in addition to yttrium and 2,3DHN, include carbonate and hydroxyl groups and water molecules. Compared to pure 2,3DHN and MTOAC, their synergistic mixture extracts yttrium with distribution coeﬃ cients approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher: for 0.005 M MTOAC in PhMe, DY = 0.47, for 0.005 М 2,3DHN DY = 2.5 × 10–5, and for their mixture DY = 32 (Fig. 2). As already noted, the maximum extraction of yttrium by mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with MTOAC is detected at pH above 11. We found that the speciﬁ c form of distribution coeﬃ cient curve for yttrium vs. pH of the aqueous phase is determined by the type of dihydroxy compound and the type of organic solvent (Fig. 3). The most eﬀ ective extractant in both solvents is 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. The lowest distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium, regardless of the type of solvent, are demonstrated by 4-tert-butylpyrocatechol. Its unsubstituted analog, pyrocatechol, extracts yttrium well only into toluene solutions. This may be due to steric factors, since the properties of phenolic groups in these extractants are very similar. High distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium were found in a water-soluble chelating agent, alizarin, giving a hydrophobic complex with MTOAC, which is concentrated in the organic phase. A solution of alizarin in butyl acetate upon contact with an aqueous phase with a pH below 12.5 forms a third phase. The possibility of eﬃ cient separation of yttrium and strontium was demonstrated by the example of 2,3DHN, the most eﬃ cient of the studied extractants (Fig. 4). The data in Fig. 4 show that at pH > 12, Y/Sr pair separation factors exceed 105 in both toluene and butyl acetate. Such a high selectivity is unattainable in the extraction of strontium with crown ethers [1] or yttrium with alkyl phosphoric acids [2] from nitric acid solutions. Small diﬀ erences in the behavior of stable and radioactive isotopes are most likely associated with a high error in determining the low activities of 90Sr and 90Y in saline solutions. An additional advantage of the studied extraction systems is the simplicity of yttrium stripping with dilute acid solutions. For the quantitative stripping of yttrium, one contact of the extract with 0.05 M solutions

Context: 2,3DHN Alazarin 1,2DHB 4 TBC 2,3DHN Alazarin 1,2DHB 4 TBC and extraction of yttrium into the organic phase is shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from the data in Fig. 6, in all the systems studied, there is a high percentage of yttrium extraction (70–80%), therewith aqueous phases consisting of ammonium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate with the addition of hydrogen peroxide proved to be more eﬀ ective. The introduction of hydrogen peroxide into the leaching solution was proposed for further oxidizing possible organic residues. Table 1 presents data on carbonate penetration and separation of yttrium from a soil sample containing the 90Y/90Sr radioactive label and stable yttrium with strontium. Based on the measurement results, the percentage of 90Y extraction from the soil was calculated (ﬁ nal value after all operations). The data obtained show that leaching from a soil sample is less eﬃ cient than from pure sand, which may be due to the high content of mineral acid salts in the soil, which pass into the aqueous phase during leaching and interfere with the complete extraction of yttrium, as well to the possibility of mechanical retention of yttrium by microdispersed particles.

Context: Abstract—Various methods have been developed for the extraction of a promising medical radionuclide 117mSn from proton-irradiated TiSb intermetallic compound, a target material suitable for irradiation with an intense beam of accelerated protons. To separate radiotin from Ti, Sb, and radionuclides of other elements, methods of ion- exchange chromatography and liquid extraction were used, in particular, the anion-exchange separation of tin and titanium in the form of a peroxide complex in HCl solution, extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions, and chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from citrate solutions. As a result, 117mSn of high purity, which meets the requirements for nuclear medicine, was obtained. Keywords: 117mSn, TiSb intermetallic compound, proton irradiation, separation of radiotin and titanium, ion exchange, extraction. DOI: 10.1134/S1066362221060114 In recent decades, the therapy of oncological and other human diseases with the use of radiopharmaceuticals (RP) has developed signiﬁ cantly. More than 80% of cancer patients suﬀ er from bone metastases [1]. Interstitial radionuclide therapy using RP based on radionuclides releasing electrons is one of the eﬀ ective methods of treating patients with widespread bone metastases. RP based on the 117mSn radionuclide (in particular, 117mSn4+DTPA) [2–5] have a number of advantages over other drugs. The decay of the metastable radionuclide 117mSn is accompanied by the release of monoenergetic conversion electrons (127, 129, and 152 keV) with a short and discrete range of 0.2–0.3 mm in biological tissue. Soft radiation leads to a local eﬀ ect on tumor cells without damaging healthy tissues. The γ-radiation (159 keV) during the decay of 117mSn may be used to control the therapeutic eﬀ ect (theranostics). Clinical trials of drugs 117mSn4+DTPA for the relief of bone pain, 117mSn4+DOTA-annexin for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and the 117mSn colloid for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are being successfully carried out [1, 6]. Until recently, 117mSn was produced mainly from the reactions of stable tin isotopes, 116Sn(n,γ)117mSn or 117Sn(n,n’γ)117mSn, with neutrons. In this case, the speciﬁ c activity of 117mSn did not exceed 740 GBq/g (20 Ci/g) [2, 7]. The presence of stable tin seriously limits the possibilities of medical application of the reactor-produced 117mSn. A product with a high speciﬁ c activity can be obtained via reactions with accelerated charged particles, of which two approaches are the most promising and demonstrate comparable production rates of 117mSn: nat,121,123Sb(p,x)117mSn [8, 9] and 116Cd(α,3n)117mSn [10,11]. Nowadays, powerful and compact cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type, developed and manufactured by the IBA Company (Belgium), are becoming more widespread, capable of accelerating proton beams with an intensity of more than 300 μA to an energy of 70 MeV. Such cyclotrons are successfully applied for large-scale production of radioisotopes, mainly for medical purposes [12, 13]. On the basis of experimentally determined cross sections, it was shown [14] that the 117mSn radionuclide can be produced by proton irradiation of an antimony target with an initial energy of 145 MeV and below. Irradiation of natural antimony or antimony enriched with 123Sb with the proton energy 55 or 70 MeV, respectively, leads to the formation of 117mSn, which contains a trace amount of the undesirable long-lived radioisotope 113Sn.

Context: gamma radiation during decay into stable 119Sn, does not interfere with medical use of 117mSn. Therefore, the implementation of the nat,123Sb(p,x)117mSn approach on cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type for producing large amounts of 117mSn of medical quality seems especially promising. In [15], we proposed a method for obtaining no-carrier-added 117mSn from a thick target of metallic antimony irradiated with protons. After dissolution of the antimony target, the radiotin was isolated by liquid- liquid extraction (LLE) with dibutyl ether, followed by exhaustive puriﬁ cation on silica gel. The method provides production of up to 3 Ci (100 GBq) 117mSn of high radionuclidic purity with a speciﬁ c activity of about 1000 Ci/g (more than 40 GBq/mg). However, since metallic antimony has low thermal conductivity, low melting point and high vapor pressure, antimony targets cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high-intensity proton currents. In addition, antimony actively interacts with many materials that are usually used for the manufacture of the target shell, which leads to its radiation damage. Instead of metallic antimony, intermetallic compounds, such as TiSb, NiSb, and AlSb, were considered as a target material, of which TiSb turned out to be the most promising [16]. The TiSb properties, unique in many respects, have been studied since the 1950s [17]. The compound combines high stability (the enthalpy of formation is estimated as –167 kJ/mol [18]), and a high melting point of 1160°C with pronounced metallic properties, including high electrical and thermal conductivity. According to our estimate, the value of the latter is twice the thermal conductivity of titanium and antimony taken separately. In the chemical separation of 117mSn from irradiated TiSb, it is necessary to remove not only macro-quantites of antimony, but also macroquantites of titanium. Previously, removal of antimony was studied in [15]. Removal of titanium is diﬃ cult due to the similarity of its chemical behavior with that of tin; in the few studies described in the literature, extraction and chromatographic separation methods are used. Sn(IV) can be extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone from 7 M HCl solutions, while Ti(IV) remains in the aqueous phase [19]. Then, the tin is reextracted with dilute solutions of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid [20]. In analytical practice, tin is also extracted with benzene from HI solutions. The extraction of tin with

Context: benzene proceeds most eﬃ ciently at a perchloric acid content of 4.66 M, sulfuric acid content of 1 M (total acidity 6.6 M), and a potassium iodide content of 0.5 M. In this case, titanium and antimony, as well as I–III metals, including indium and scandium, are not extracted [21]. Tin is reextracted with a 1–2 M HCl solution. However, this technique was developed only for the analytical determination of milligram amounts of tin [22]; its applicability for isolation of no-carrier- added radiotin has not been studied. Chromatographic separation of Ti(IV) from ions of other metals is possible by sorption of titanium in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on a weakly basic anion exchanger Amberlite CG-4B [23]. A similar behavior of Ti(IV) is observed on AG 50W-X8 and Dowex 50W cation exchangers in 0.05 M H2SO4 solutions with the addition of 1% H2O2 [24]. Ti(IV) is not adsorbed on strongly basic anion-exchange resins (Dowex 1×8 and AG 1 × 8) [25]. As known, Ti forms peroxide complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+, positively charged and stable in strongly acidic solutions. At the same time, Sn forms the anionic complex [SnCl6]2– in strong hydrochloric acid solutions; therefore, the separation of oppositely charged Sn and Ti complexes can be carried out both on cation-exchange and anion-exchange resins. For example, when a hydrochloric acid solution of Sn and Ti containing a minor excess of H2O2, is passed through an anion-exchange resin, [SnCl6]2– anions are adsorbed, whereas [TiO(H2O2)] cations pass through the column. Then, tin is desorbed by passing through the column solutions that decompose the [SnCl6]2– anionic complex. For separating trace amounts of tin from macroquantites of titanium, this method is preferable, since it does not require large volumes of sorbent. Basically, the methods presented in the literature have been developed for the separation of macroquantities of Sn, Sb, and Ti, while the behavior of radionuclides in the “no-carrier-added” state can diﬀ er signiﬁ cantly. When producing 117mSn of high speciﬁ c activity, it is necessary to separate the macroquantites of Sb and Ti from the ul- tramicroquantities of Sn. In addition, proton irradiation of antimony and titanium produces other radionuclides, capable of aﬀ ecting purity of the target product, and they must also be separated from tin. In this study, we propose options for the extraction of 117mSn with a high speciﬁ c activity from the proton-irradiated antimony– titanium intermetallic compound to prepare RP.

Context: Preparation and irradiation of experimental targets. The radionuclides 124Sb (carrier-added), 113Sn, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn (no-carrier-added) used in this study for model experiments were obtained from irradiated antimony targets by the method described in [9]. 44Ti was supplied by CJSC Cyclotron (Obninsk). Antimony–titanium intermetallic compound was formed by argon-arc melting of antimony and titanium powder in a molar ratio of 1: 1 [16]. To prepare the target, the crushed intermetallide was placed in an electron-beam welded titanium container 5 mm thick and was heated at a temperature of 910°C and a pressure of 150 MPa in argon for 1.5 h [26]. To produce radionuclides and study their chemical behavior, targets from the TiSb intermetallic compound and also from metallic antimony were irradiated. The activity of the used radionuclides was in the range of several μCi (~ 100 kBq). Irradiation was carried out at a high-precision accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research (Troitsk, Moscow) with the initial proton beam energy varied from 110 to 140 MeV and at the current 1–50 μA [27]. Materials and reagents. For preparing aqueous solutions, we used concentrated acids (HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4) and deionized water from a Millipore Simplicity water puriﬁ cation unit. Antimony was extracted with dibutyl ether. For chromatographic separation of titanium, we used: (1) strongly basic monofunctional anionites AG 1×8 (Bio Rad, USA) and Dowex 1×8 (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –N+(CН3)3 as the mai functional group; (2) Dowex 50×8 cation exchanger (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –SO3H as the main functional group.

Context:  For the chromatographic puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, we prepared 10 mL of model solutions containing Ti, Sb, H2O2, 6 M HCl, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn). The content of Ti varied from 1.5 to 30 g/L, the Sb content varied from (2–5)×10–3 g/L, a value corresponding to the addition of the 124Sb label, to 14.4 g/L, the H2O2 : Ti molar ratio was from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1. The label was obtained from an irradiated antimony target. The sorption and desorption of tin was performed under dynamic conditions by passing the solution through a column (d = 0.6 cm) with a sorbent layer 6 cm high. Two anion-exchange resins were used as sorbents: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Before ﬁ lling the column, the sorbents were kept in 6 M HCl for 12 h. First, 10 mL of the initial solution was passed through the ﬁ lled column at a rate of 0.8 mL/min and then 40–50 mL of a 6 M HCl washing solution passed. For desorption of radiotin, 1–4 M HNO3 solutions were used. Model solutions used for extraction have a total acidity of 6.6 M and a volume of 30 mL and contain 4.66 М HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, Ti (20 g/L), Sb in the form of antimony chloride with a concentration from (2– 5)×10–3 to 1 g/L, and 0.2–1 М KI. Also, (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn) produced from the irradiated antimony target was added to the model solution as label. To prepare a model solution, a weighed portion of KI was preliminarily dissolved in a minor amount of water and added, with vigorous stirring, to a mixture of HClO4 and H2SO4 acids. Iodine was formed, and the larger the weight of KI sample, the darker the solution. However, even at low KI concentrations, when the solution was light yellow, a precipitate formed, presumably HIO. The solution was left for a day to reach equilibrium. Then, it was ﬁ ltered, and the label and stable titanium and antimony were added, and after that, the extraction was performed.

Context: Isolation of no-carrier-added 117mSn from an irradiated antimony target is not an easy task, since these elements have similar chemical behavior. In the case of the separation of 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound, the task is complicated by the need to purify also from titanium, which also exhibits chemical properties close to that of tin. Therefore, the main task of this study was the eﬃ cient separation, providing a high chemical yield, of radiotin from the macrocomponents of antimony and titanium. For puriﬁ cation from the main amount of antimony in the presence of titanium, we used extraction with dibutyl ether, which was described previously in the absence of titanium in [15]. Extraction was performed from a model 10 M HCl solution containing 55 g/L Sb, 20 g/L Ti, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, and 44Ti) (Table 2). The study showed that following three successive extractions, more than 99.7% of antimony passes into dibutyl ether, while radiotin and titanium remain in the aqueous phase. After the ﬁ rst stage of extraction, the concentration of antimony decreases to 1.5 g/L. After three stages, it may be reduced to 0.1 g/ L. More than 95% of titanium and radiotin remain in the aqueous phase. It was found that the extraction of antimony in the presence of titanium proceeds in the same way as in its absence. For the subsequent puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium macroquantities, both chromatography on strong anion exchangers with the addition of hydrogen peroxide and extraction with benzene from iodide solutions were used.

Context: of positively charged complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+. These complexes are stable in acidic media, including HCl, in which tin forms the anionic complexes [SnCl6]2–. Our preliminary experiments showed that Ti macroquantities are not sorbed from 2 M HCl and are not completely sorbed from 1 M HCl. The ion-exchange separation of radiotin from titanium was carried out from 0.5 M HCl, while the titanium concentration was reduced by a factor of 20. However, this method is not entirely suitable for solving our problem, since large volumes of sorbent are required to remove macroamounts of titanium, which should be disposed and lead to the loss of radiotin. The separation of radiotin from titanium on strongly basic anion exchangers turned out to be more promising approach. The above possibility was studied on model solutions. The chromatographic procedure consisted of passing a hydrochloric acid solution of radiotin and titanium, containing a small stoichiometric excess of H2O2, through an anion exchange resin. In this case, [SnCl6]2– anions were sorbed on the column, while [TiO(H2O2)]2+ cations passed through the column. The column was washed with 6 M HCl to remove titanium. The titanium concentration in the washing solution and, as a consequence, in the target product depended on the degree of puriﬁ cation of the initial solution from macroamounts of antimony (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that an increase in the antimony concentration has adverse eﬀ ect on the puriﬁ cation from titanium. Next, we compared the eﬃ ciency of puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, tellurium, and antimony residues on two strongly basic anion exchangers: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Both resins, similar in composition but diﬀ ering in brands, have approximately the same eﬀ ect in relation to tin, tellurium, and antimony radionuclides.

Context: Fig. 1. Dependence of the titanium concentration in a 6 M HCl washing solution on the concentration of antimony in the initial solution. Sorbent AG 1 × 8, column 0.6 cm in diameter and 6 cm in height, ﬂ ow rate 0.8 mL/min. Antimony concentration, g/L: (1) (2–5) 10–3, (2) 3.6, and (3) 14.4. column ﬁ lled with AG 1 × 8, especially in the presence of macroamounts of antimony. Therefore, further experiments were performed with AG 1 × 8 resin. After washing, part of tellurium remains on the column, in addition to radiotin. Radiotin was eluted with a nitric acid solution, which decomposes the anionic complex. Table 3 shows the dependence of the amount of radiotin remaining in the adsorbed state on the nitric acid concentration. With an increase in the HNO3 concentration, the yield of radiotin increases, while tellurium radionuclides start to desorb simultaneously. Optimal for elution is 2 M HNO3. In this case, a radiotin yield of about 90% is achieved, and the content of tellurium radionuclides is reduced by about 2-fold. Heating nitric acid to 40°C increases the radiotin yield up to 98%. A high content of antimony in the initial solution not only has adverse eﬀ ect on the removal of titanium, but also decreases the yield of radiotin, which can be seen from the integral curves of 113Sn elution at various concentrations of antimony in the initial solutions (Fig. 3). Increasing the antimony concentration in the solution to 3.6 g/L reduces the radiotin yield to 90%. Thus, the presence of antimony with a concentration on the order of 1 g/L will be quite acceptable for eﬃ cient separation of 117mSn and titanium at this stage. Change in the chromatographic behavior can be followed in Fig.4, demonstrating curves of elution of antimony from the column upon washing with a 6 M HCl and desorption of radiotin in a 2 M HNO3 on the antimony concentration in the initial solution. As seen, with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, it is less retained by the sorbent upon passage of 6 M HCl and is desorbed with 2 M HNO3 by a broader peak. Based on the above dependences, the following optimal parameters of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and titanium were determined:

Context:  – selective elution of titanium with respect to radiotin should be carried out in a 6 M HCl (for a chromatographic column volume of 2.5–3 mL and a sorbent layer height of 6–7 cm, 50 mL of 6 M HCl is suﬃ cient). For desorption of radiotin, a 2 M HNO3 solution heated to 40°C should be used; with the above column parameters, 25 mL of 2 M HNO3 is suﬃ cient to extract 98–99% of the radiotin. The puriﬁ cation factor from Ti depends on its concentration in the initial solution and reaches 104 at a titanium concentration of 25 g/L; a puriﬁ cation factor of up to 106 may be achieved after two stages of chromatographic puriﬁ cation. Extraction separation of radiotin from titanium. Along with the chromatographic method, extraction methods are also used to separate radiotin from titanium macroquantities. One of these methods is extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone [19]. Our model experiments showed that methyl isobutyl ketone extracts up to 80% of radiotin from 7 M HCl, while the titanium concentration decreases 200 times. The extraction of radiotin from a solution of 7 M Another extraction method of separation from titanium, providing up to 99-% yield, is the extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions. This method was studied for the separation of milligram amounts of tin from titanium and antimony in [21]. The behavior of a no-carrier-added tin may diﬀ er from the behavior of macroscopic amounts of tin. The diﬀ erence in the extraction behavior of tin is mainly inﬂ uenced by the concentration of stable antimony and iodide ions. It was shown in [15] that after the removal of antimony by extraction with dibutyl ether, a minor amount of it nevertheless remains in the solution. At the ﬁ rst stage, the eﬀ ect of the concentration of antimony in the initial solution on the extraction of radiotin with benzene was studied. In this case, the KI concentration was kept constant (0.5 M). In the studied range of antimony concentrations (2–5) × 10–3–1 g/L, at least 98% of radiotin is extracted with two 10-mL portions of benzene. The dependence of the extraction of antimony on its concentration in the initial solution is demonstrated in Fig. 5. As seen, the more antimony in the initial solution, the more it is extracted into the organic phase (salting out eﬀ ect). Therefore, the antimony concentration should be minimal.

Loss on the sediment formed in the organic phase after extraction and on the surface of chemical glassware. Curve: (1) antimony (124Sb) and (2) 113Sn. For reextraction of radiotin from the organic phase, we used 1.5 M HCl and 0.25 M H2SO4 solutions proposed in the literature [22]. The eﬃ ciencies of reextraction with solutions of both acids were found to be close. Since further puriﬁ cation was performed in hydrochloric acid solutions, 1.5 M HCl was used for reextraction. The inﬂ uence of the initial concentration of antimony on the reextraction was investigated. In particular, it was shown that with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, the puriﬁ cation degree of radiotin, reextracted from benzene, from titanium also decreases (Fig. 5). It was found that after a certain time (within an hour) elapsed after extraction, a white precipitate formed in the organic phase. For tin rextraction, the organic phase was decanted, with some radiotin remaining on the sediment and on the surface of the chemical glassware (Fig. 6). The inﬂ uence of the concentration of antimony and iodide ions in the initial solution on the loss of radionu- clides in the sediment was studied. As seen, the loss of ra- diotin in the sediment increases with increasing antimony concentration (Fig. 6).

Context: extracted in signiﬁ cant quantities, antimony remains the only macrocomponent that can lead to insoluble com- pounds. Based on the fact that the content of antimony in the precipitate increases with concentrations of both antimony and KI, it can be assumed that the precipitate is Sb(V) iodide or its derivatives. The eﬀ ect of the concentration of iodide ions on the course of extraction was studied at the constant concentration of antimony in the initial solution equal to 0.1 g/L. It was found that, in the concentration range studied, 0.2–1 M, the KI concentration dramatically aﬀ ects the extraction of radiotin and antimony: at low concentra- tions, antimony is extracted, while up to 70% of radiotin remains in the aqueous phase. With an increase in the KI concentration, the behavior of the elements changes: the radiotin quantitatively leaves the aqueous phase, while the antimony remains (Fig. 7). Analysis of the obtained experimental data showed that more than 98% of titani- um and tellurium radionuclides remained in the aqueous phase after extraction with benzene. In addition, iodide ions contribute to a more complete separation of radio- tin from titanium. With KI concentration increased from 0.2 to 1 mol/L, the degree of puriﬁ cation from titanium is increased by a factor of 4–5. Based on the above dependences, the optimal parameters of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium were selected: – the concentration of antimony in the initial solu- tion should be below 0.1 g/L, i.e. it must ﬁ rst be re- moved, for example, by extraction with dibutyl ether;

Context:  Thus, titanium can be almost completely removed from radiotin by extraction with benzene, whereas trace amounts of antimony and tellurium present in the product may be removed by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel. On processing an irradiated antimony target, such a ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation was performed in a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5), which, in turn, was prepared from a 10 M HCl solution, which is determined by the previous stage of processing described in [15]. In the case of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, a sodium citrate solution was prepared from a 1.5 M HCl solution, and in the case of chromatographic separation on AG 1 × 8 resin, the preceding solution was 2 M HNO3, not HCl. We checked how traces of nitrate ions aﬀ ect the chromatography eﬃ ciency on silica gel, the formation of antimony complexes with citrate ions in particular. To do this, a citrate solution containing 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was prepared starting from a 2 M HNO3. The solution was passed through a column ﬁ lled with SiO2, then the column was washed, and radiotin was eluted with 6 M HCl according to the method described in [15]. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 8. It follows from Fig. 5 that the radionuclides Sn, Sb, and Te behave in the same way, as in the absence of nitrate aions. In this case, about 45% of 44Ti remains on the column. Isolation of radiotin from an irradiated TiSb sample. After the process of radiotin separation was studied in model experiments, an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound was fabricated and irradiated. The chemical and physical properties of TiSb have been little studied. To study the interaction of TiSb with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were successively dissolved in concentrated HCl and then in concentrated HCl with the addition of HNO3. Heating TiSb in concentrated hydrochloric acid caused solution to turn violet (owing to the formation of Ti3+ ions). As the sample dissolved, the reaction rate decreased. The addition of H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 leads to the resumption of dissolution. However, in this case, Ti3+ transforms into Ti4+, causing precipitation and passivation of the TiSb surface. We succeeded in performing complete dissolution as follows. The bead of the compound was placed in a ﬂ ask, and a concentrated HCl was added. The ﬂ ask was heated for 12 h at reﬂ ux temperature. Solution (no. 1) turned deep violet, indicating the formation of Ti3+ ions. Then, the insoluble residue was transferred into a ﬂ ask with a fresh portion of concentrated HCl, and

Context: Ti, 114mln, 46Sc tellurium occurs. For the ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of the radiotin, chromatographic separation on silica gel was carried out as described above. As a result, the total yield of 117mSn was 75–82%, the puriﬁ cation factors for Sb and Ti were about 106, and the radionuclidic purity of 117mSn was no less than 99.9% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated). Second portion of the solution prepared by dissolving TiSb was transferred into a solution containing 4.66 M HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, and 1 M KI, and the radiotin was extracted twice with benzene. Then, radiotin was reextracted from benzene with 1.5 M HCl. Like chromatography, this method provided puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, indium, and scandium radionuclides. Trace amounts of antimony and tellurium impurities (Table 4) remained after the extraction were removed by further adsorption on silica gel from citrate solutions. In the given case, the total yield of 117mSn was 80– 85%, the puriﬁ cation factor for Sb and Ti, about 106, and the radionuclidic purity was no less than 99.7% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated).

Using the chromatography method, we studied the possibility of separating radiotin in the form of [SnCl6]2– from titanium in the form of an oppositely charged complex [TiO (H2O2)]2+ on strong AG 1 × 8 and

Context:  Dowex 1 × 8 anion exchangers from a 6 M HCl solution in the presence of H2O2. It was shown that AG-1 × 8 provides higher puriﬁ cation eﬃ ciency. In the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, the best results were achieved for the extraction of radiotin with benzene from a solution containing a mixture of perchloric and sulfuric acids and iodide ions with a concentration of 0.5–1 M. Each of the methods used has its own advantages and disadvantages [30]. In our case, the advantage of extraction in comparison with chromatography is the short time of the process, and the disadvantage is a slightly lower yield of radiotin and worsening of its puriﬁ cation from titanium at a residual concentration of antimony in the initial solution above 0.1 g/L. In our opinion, the method of titanium separation on the AG 1 × 8 anion exchanger is most preferable, since it, although being more time-consuming, is less sensi- tive to the antimony content in the initial solution (about 1 g/L), and is also easier-to-implement in hot chambers. In both methods, the separation of radiotin was terminated by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate at pH 5.5. As a result, the 117mSn product with high radionuclidic purity and high speciﬁ c activity was obtained in at least 75-% yield, which is promising for the development of production technology of 117mSn in large quantities in the future.

Context:  Abstract(cid:0)Diffusion-thermal procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I for radionuclide therapy and positron emission tomography are suggested. For these procedures, new cyclotron targets of metallic tantalum were developed, which, when exposed to high irradiation doses, ensure the absence of physicochemical interaction (diffusion, alloying) of materials being activated and final products with the support at high temperatures. The thermal, hydrodynamic, and strength characteristics of zinc and tellurium (elemental Te) cyclotron targets were evaluated. For commercial target assembly of the COSTIS system, the operation parameters of the proc- ess for preparing 124I from elemental tellurium using the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerators were determined. Recent efforts of leading scientific laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Hammersmith Hospital, etc.) were focused on the development of procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I [1(cid:0)3]. This is due to the unique nuclear-physical properties of 67Cu and 124I, possibility of their production on compact cyclotrons, accelerators of high-energy charged particles, electron accelerators, and moderate-power reactors, and also to rich and well-studied chemistry of these elements. 67Cu is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 2.58 days) undergoing (cid:2)-decay (100%) [4]. A short path of elec- trons with the energy from 181.5 to 575.0 keV in a living body allows elimination of tumors with a diam- eter of up to 5 mm [5]. The inherent (cid:3)-ray radiation of this radionuclide, whose energy spectrum and quan- tum yield (see below) are similar to those of 67Ga widely used in single-photon emission tomography, is efficiently registered with a commercial scintillation (cid:3)-ray chamber providing reliable monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body.

Replacement of the key diagnostic radionuclide iodine-123 by 124I in known RPs such as solution of sodium iodide, solution of sodium o-iodohippurate, m-iodobenzylguanidine, and Iodofen would substantially improve these prepara- tions.

Context: Copper-67 can be isolated in a metallic vacuum chamber providing the residual pressure in the work- ing volume as low as 10(cid:2)6 mm Hg. The pilot model was presented previously in [14]; now in collaboration with the Institute of Analytical Instrument-Making we developed a new commercial installation. The chamber is equipped with special fittings for connect- ing a vacuum pump (turbomolecular pump is prefer- replaceable con- able), denser for the evaporated staring isotope and impurity gallium radionuclides, water supply unit, valves for inert gas supply, heater, and thermocouples. The con- denser is hermetically connected to a water supply unit, which is connected through a pipe with a water cooling system used in the course of distillation to maintain the required temperature. A furnace (equipped with a holder for irradiated target) is ar- ranged over the condenser using a movable rod; the required temperature is controlled with thermocouples.

Context: Using the pilot vacuum chamber, we isolated the products of nuclear reactions from natural metal zinc irradiated with deuterons (13.6/6.0 MeV). Zinc was virtually quantitatively removed from the irradiated target: after treatment, no photopeaks at 0.4386 [69mZn, 68Zn(d, p)] and 1.116 MeV [65Zn, 64Zn(d, p)] were recorded. The yields of 66Ga [66Zn(d, 2n)], 67Ga [66Zn(d, n) and 67Zn(d, 2n)], and 64Cu [66Zn(d, (cid:4)) and 67Zn(d, (cid:4)n)] were about 98%, whereas the content of impurity zinc radionuclides was less than 0.02%. A significant difference in the vapor pressures of all the elements to be separated (Zn, Cu, Ga) in a wide temperature range (Fig. 2) should allow prepara- tion of 67Cu with a radionuclide purity of about 99%.

Context: Irrespective of the procedure of radionuclide ac- cumulation, 67Cu can be isolated by vacuum distilla- tion separation of the irradiated zinc targets performed at temperature and pressure providing their complete removal and excluding evaporation of the desired product. This procedure is based on the difference of the evaporation rates and partial vapor pressures of the elements being separated over the solid phase [13]. This method requires changes in the common design of the cyclotron targets (copper or silver sup- ports with deposited isotope material; their modifica- tion should exclude physicochemical interaction (dif- fusion, alloying) of the material being activated and final radionuclides with the support material at elevated temperatures. One of possible solutions is preparation of the targets from inert high-melting materials. Special cyclotron supports were developed for ir- radiation of zinc targets in derived beams of domestic reactors (e.g., U-120 reactor of the St. Petersburg University). In this target, the material to be activated is deposited on a thin (750 (cid:5)m) tantalum support (24 mm in diameter); the (cid:6)loss(cid:7) in the thermal con- ductivity of tantalum as compared to silver and zinc is compensated by optimal combination of the strength and mechanical properties.

Context:  The optimal energy of protons and the yields of the final product and impurity 123I were evaluated using the reference data [7]. However, the data on the in- dustrial production of 124I at the Hammersmith Hos- pital (London, the United Kingdom) [3] showed that the absolute yields of 124I given in this handbook are underestimated by a factor of almost 3.5. For example, the yield of 124I at irradiation of the enriched tellurium target with 12.5-MeV protons is 2.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, and not 0.76 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, as given above. At the same time, the ratios of 124I and 123I are similar: only 2% of 123I is remains in the target after irradiation of the enriched tellurium (99.8%) target.

Context: (Rules and Regulations in Nuclear Power Engineer- ing, hereinafter PNAE) [16]. Criteria for selection of the support material. Comparative analysis of thermal and mechanical prop- erties of these metals (V, Nb, Ta) [6] and typical products of nuclear reactions showed that metallic tan- talum is the best support material for elemental tel- lurium. As compared to commonly used materials (Ag, Cu, Al, Pt), the loss in the thermal conductivity can be compensated by a decrease in the target thick- ness owing to higher strength properties of tantalum. The main aim of this part of the study was to deter- mine the process parameters of preparing 124I under the conditions of operation of the industrial target as- sembly of the COSTIS system (COmpact Solid Target Irradiation System) for the derived beam of the IBA Cyclone 18/9 accelerator. Main parameters of thermal processes in the course of irradiation of tellurium target on tan- talum support are given in Table 2. All further calculations were carried out taking into the data on the operation conditions and account geometric size of the target assembly of the COSTIS system (Fig. 3). In our calculations we used the following data: size of the support disc (24 mm in diameter, 2 mm thick), diameter of the effective irradiation area (12 mm), size of the inlet titanium foil (12 mm in diameter, 0.05 mm thick); temperature of the target assembly (15(cid:0)30(cid:8)C), helium flow rate (25 l min(cid:2)1), water flow rate (16 l min(cid:2)1), and water pressure (0.5 MPa). Since the tellurium target is cooled from the op- posite sides with water and helium, maximal tempera- tures are observed in the material bulk and not on the target surface. The coefficient of heat transfer at the tellurium(cid:0)helium boundary can be calculated only when the helium pressure is known (or set); it can be calculated taking into account the size of titanium window and the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 Calculations of the main characteristics of the helium heat exchanger. Helium heat exchanger is a diffuser(cid:0)confuser. Arrangement of the tellurium and titanium surfaces in the area of this unit strongly intensifies the heat exchange; the diffuser divergence (or confuser convergence) angles in the direction of titanium increase the coefficient of heat transfer at the helium(cid:0)titanium boundary, providing more efficient cooling. At a proton beam current of 15 (cid:5)A, the foil re- ceives 11.2 W and can be cooled by helium convec- tion (at a helium pressure PHe 30 mm Hg) if its mech- anical contact with the stainless-steel frame of the heat exchanger is efficient. With a decrease in the working pressure from 30 to 20 mm Hg, the temperature of the titanium foil de- creases from 136 to 112 (cid:8)C, and the conditional coef- ficient of the pressure reserve increases by a factor of almost 2. However, operation under such conditions is impossible because of the extremely high helium flow velocity (1306 m s(cid:2)1 at PHe < 25 mm Hg) exceeding the speed of sound ((cid:9)1060 m s(cid:2)1). Our calculations of the helium pressures in accor- dance with the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 [16] showed that the titanium foil can operate at a helium pressure of 30 mm Hg. The maximal working stresses are smaller than 100 MPa at a maximal tem- perature of the titanium window of 138(cid:8)C. With an in- crease in the helium pressure, the mechanical stresses linearly increase; the breaking stress decreases because of increasing temperature of the foil. Evaluation of the principal dimensions of the tantalum support and its strength; determination of the working temperatures of the support and tellurium target.

Because importance of deformation characteristics, we of decided to equalize deflections along the axis of the COSTIS target and the suggested unit; as a result, STe was taken as 750 (cid:5)m. This decreases the heat transfer in a support in the radial directions by 30% in comparison with a platinum support of the same this decrease is not decisive. thickness. However, Our calculations of the stresses and deflections of the tantalum target as influenced by the pressure of cooling water and heat load (i.e., current of the charged particle beam) of the cyclotron target showed that the whole target cross section operates under the conditions of small compression stresses (from (cid:0)14 to (cid:0) 45 MPa), which is the best regime providing stable operation of the metal for more than 100 h at beam currents of up to 20 (cid:5)A.

Context:  Using the procedure for longitudinal flow along an impermeable plate [17, 18], we determined the coeffi- cients of heat transfer of tantalum in water of 98 000 (cid:0) 67 200 W m(cid:2)2 K(cid:2)1, decreasing in the direction from the center. Taking into account these coefficients, we found that the maximal temperature in the irradiated layer of elemental tellurium is lower than 545.6 K (272.6(cid:8)C). Thus, our calculations showed the principal suit- ability of the target of elemental tellurium deposited on a tantalum support; the most dangerous cross sec- tion of the support operates under the compression conditions, which allows the beam current to be in- creased to 20 (cid:5)A. To decrease the deflection of the tantalum support (i.e., to eliminate the possibility of exfoliation of elemental tellurium), its thickness can be increased to 1(cid:0)1.5 mm.

Context: Because of weak interaction between the elements, formation of a strong tellurium coating directly on tantalum is impossible. Thus, it is necessary to make a thin intermediate layer providing sufficient diffusion junction of the composite without affecting the heat transfer. The material of this layer should be characterized by the intermediate (between Ta and Te) coefficients of linear thermal expansion, fairly high thermal con- ductivity (to provide satisfactory heat removal during irradiation), ability to form strong coatings on the tan- talum surface, high adhesion to tellurium to prepare strong coatings withstanding repeated cycles of irra- diation and thermal treatment of the targets, and absence of the volatile products of nuclear reactions proceeding in the course of proton irradiation. Metallic Ni is the most appropriate for this pur- pose: LCTEs of Ta, Ni, and Te (K(cid:2)1) are 6.79 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 (373(cid:0) 673 K), 13.2 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 (143(cid:0) 693 K), and 17.0 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)6 K(cid:2)1 (273(cid:0)373 K), respectively [6]; the heat con- ductivities of Ta, Ni, and Te (W m(cid:2)1 K(cid:2)1), 45.3(cid:0)53.6 (273(cid:0) 673 K), 67.0 (cid:0)71.4 (293(cid:0)500 K), and 1.8(cid:0)1.34 (350(cid:0)700 K), respectively [6]. High mutual solubility of Ta and Ni and Ni and Te [19] should provide the required diffusion junction of the elements and stabil- ity of the final three-layer composite in the repeated cycles of irradiation and thermal treatment. Irradiation of nickel with protons yields radionuclides of cobalt and copper, whose vapor pressure at 700 K is less than 1 (cid:10) 10(cid:2)16 atm [6]. The optimal procedure to prepare the intermediate layer of 3(cid:0)5 (cid:5)m thickness is electroplating, nickel which is widely used in mechanical engineering. Then, the layer of elemental tellurium can be depos- ited by fusion in an inert atmosphere.

Context: Abstract—Deep puriﬁ cation of the stripped 90Y obtained after the 90Sr/90Y pair extraction separation with D2EHPA from chemical impurities (Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Fe, Zr) employing the TODGA-containing sorbent AXIONIT MND 40T was considered. Also, a two-stage sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair without using the extraction method was developed. At the ﬁ rst stage the 90Y was separated from 90Sr with Purolite D5041 phosphate cation exchange resin, and at the second stage, 90Y deep puriﬁ cation was carried out on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent. The prepared 90Y in radiochemical purity meets the requirements for radiopharmaceuticals. Keywords: sorption, separation, strontium, yttrium, radiopharmaceutical DOI: 10.1134/S1066362221060102

Context: Radionuclide 90Y is one of the ﬁ rst radioactive isotopes to be used for radiotherapy and the interest in 90Y continues although more than 30 radionuclides are currently used for this purpose. This interest is due to its convenient nuclear-physical properties: a half-life of 64.2 h and a maximum β-energy of 2.27 MeV. 90Y is used for a variety of therapeutic purposes including radioimmunotherapy with labeled antibodies, treatment of liver tumors and rheumatoid arthritis [1]. 90Y is formed during the decay of the long-lived radioisotope 90Sr, which is a ﬁ ssion product of uranium. One of the important requirements for the safe clinical use of 90Y is deep puriﬁ cation from 90Sr, which has a high aﬃ nity for bone tissue and can cause bone marrow damage. The regulated 90Sr content in the 90Y radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine for therapeutic procedures should not exceed 2 × 10–6 Ci/Ci of 90Y. In addition, there are strict requirements for the heavy metal content, which in a 90Y radiopharmaceutical in total should not exceed 10 μg per 1 Ci of 90Y [2, 3]. In order to produce the ﬁ nal product with the required purity, an 90Y multistage puriﬁ cation from chemical and radiochemical impurities is carried out, mainly by liquid extraction and ion exchange methods [1]. Each of these methods has its own limitations and disadvantages. Thus, ion-exchange methods for producing 90Y are quite simple to implement, however, the long duration of sorption processes (18–20 h) leads to signiﬁ cant losses of the ﬁ nished product due to its decomposition. In practice, isotope generators are often used. Their action is based on the sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair on a sulfonic cation exchange resin, for example, Dowex 50W×8. In this case, the 90Y yield is 90–98%, but the 90Sr impurity gradually increases due to the radiation destruction of the resin. Moreover, additional operations of chemical treatment of eluates are required to convert 90Y into a form suitable for further use (0.01 mol/dm3 HCl solution). The method of liquid extraction employing di- 2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid (D2EHPA) is currently considered the most eﬀ ective method for separating an equilibrium 90Y/90Sr mixture. The extraction proceeds rather quickly: the total time of the 90Y extraction process is 30–60 min, the yield of the target product is more than 95%, and the 90Sr content in the ﬁ nished product is less than 10–6%. However, the obtained 90Y contains, in addition to residual amounts of 90Sr, impurities of corrosion products (Fe, Ni, Cr, Pb, etc.)

Context: to organophosphate compounds, extractants based on diglycolic acid diamides, in particular, tetraoctyldiglycolamide (TODGA), can be used as an active component in the TVEX composition. DGA resin sorbent based on styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer and TODGA is produced by Triskem International (France) and is used for the extraction and separation of radioactive REE and TPE for radioanalysis [6]. There is no information on the use of TODGA- containing sorbents to produce high-purity 90Y. The nature of the REE sorption (by the example of the 152Eu sorption) on the TVEX-TODGA was previously considered in [7, 8]. Due to the fact that yttrium is a chemical analogue of REE, it can be assumed that the patterns of the europium and yttrium sorption on the studied sorbents will be similar. In the study we investigated the possibility of deep puriﬁ cation of the yttrium-90 after extraction separation of 90Y from 90Sr with D2EHPA using a TODGA-containing AXIONIT MND 40T, TVEX of Russian production, and we also studied the conditions for the sorption separation of 90Y from 90Sr using phosphate cation exchange resin and AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent.

In the study we investigated the possibility of deep puriﬁ cation of the yttrium-90 after extraction separation of 90Y from 90Sr with D2EHPA using a TODGA-containing AXIONIT MND 40T, TVEX of Russian production, and we also studied the conditions for the sorption separation of 90Y from 90Sr using phosphate cation exchange resin and AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent.

Context: divinylbenzene copolymer was used as a carrier. The TODGA content in the sorbent was 40 wt %, the granule size was 0.315–0.50 mm. For puriﬁ cation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column lled with AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent, the volume ﬁ of the sorbent in the column was 4 cm3. Before the experiments, the sorbent was treated in a column with a 5 M nitric acid solution for 2 h. At the sorption stage the initial solution was passed through the column at a rate of 6.0 column volumes per an hour [(c.v.)/h]. The ﬁ ltrate at the column outlet was collected and tested for the amounts of chemical impurities. After the end of the sorption, a 3 M HCl solution was passed through the column at a rate of 3.0 c.v./h to remove the initial solution residues. Desorption of 90Y was performed with 0.01 M HCl. The passing rate was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. The supply of the solutions during pre-treatment and at all stages was carried out using a peristaltic pump from bottom to top. The total time of sorption puriﬁ cation was 5–6 h. Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The 90Sr/90Y pair separation experiments were carried out employing a model solution containing 1.5 g/dm3 strontium and 0.15 mg/dm3 yttrium nitrates and 0.01– 0.3 M nitric acid therewith a label of the equilibrium 90Sr/90Y pair was introduced into the model solution in an amount of about 105 Bq/dm3. At the ﬁ rst stage of separation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 D5041 phosphate cation exchange resin (Purolite, Great Britain). Then the sorbent was washed with a 0.01–0.3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 3 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined. At the second stage of separation, hydrochloric acid desorbate was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent. Then the sorbent was washed with a 3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 0.01 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined for at least 35 days. The setup scheme is shown in Fig. 1.

Context:  Fig. 2. Relative beta activity (A/Ain) vs. the exposure time of (a) filtrates and (b) desorbates in 3 M HCl obtained after sorption with a D5041 cation exchange resin. HNO3 concentration in solution during sorption, M: (1) 0.01, (2) 0.1, (3) 0.2, (4) 0.3. The dotted line is the calculated 90Y decay curve. eﬃ ciency is observed for impurities of aluminum, phosphorus, and calcium (Kpur = 2.7–3.9). During the experiments, three consecutive treatment cycles were carried out without replacing the sorbent. The results obtained showed that the puriﬁ cation factors remain at a constant level. Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The sorption method was tested for direct separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair without using the extraction method. The sorption completeness of 90Y and 90Sr on the ﬁ rst column ﬁ lled with phosphate cation exchange resin D5041 can be evidenced by the change in the relative beta activity (A/Ain) of the ﬁ ltrate over 35–50 days. The results are shown in Fig. 2a, curve 1. These results demonstrate that sorption from a 0.01 M HNO3 solution is accompanied by the combined sorption of 90Sr and 90Y. The relative beta activity of the ﬁ ltrate changes relatively little over time and its equilibrium value is about 20% of the initial value. With an increase in the nitric acid concentration the time dependence of the A/Ain value of the ﬁ ltrate changes sharply. At a 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 concentration at ﬁ rst the A/Ain value is ~0.4, and the equilibrium value, 0.8–0.9. This fact indicates that during the sorption of the equilibrium 90Sr/90Y mixture in this acidity range, almost all 90Sr remains in the ﬁ ltrate, and 90Y is completely sorbed on the column. When the sorbent is washed after sorption with 0.2–0.3 M HCl, additional elution of residual amounts of 90Sr occurs.

Context: The above is conﬁ rmed by the time dependences of the relative beta activity of hydrochloric acid desorbates (3 M) obtained after sorption with a D5041 cation exchange resin from solutions with diﬀ erent HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 2b). Figures 2b shows, for clarity, the calculated decay curve of pure radionuclide 90Y calculated according to the radioactive decay law. The results on Fig. 2b show that hydrochloric acid desorbates obtained after the 90Sr/90Y pair sorption by the D5041 cation exchange resin from 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 solutions and washing with HCl solutions of the same concentrations contain almost pure 90Y. The residual activity of desorbates after keeping for 45 days does not exceed 0.1% of the initial activity of the solution, and the experimental and calculated decomposition curves of desorbates almost completely coincide. Due to the fact that even deeper puriﬁ cation of 90Y from 90Sr is required for use in the production of radiopharmaceuticals, the obtained hydrochloric acid desorbates were subjected to additional puriﬁ cation with the TODGA-containing sorbent AXIONIT MND 40T. Sorbents of this type are capable of eﬃ cient sorption of REE and Y in strongly acidic media including hydrochloric acid. In acid solutions with a concentration of less than 0.1 M the sorption of REE(Y) sharply decreases, which makes it possible to carry out their desorption.

Context: solutions with a concentration above 3 M the complete yttrium extraction occurs, while the sorption of strontium and corrosion products on this sorbent practically does not occur. This allows at the sorption stage to carry out deep puriﬁ cation of 90Y from 90Sr and a wide range of chemical impurities (chromium, manganese, nickel, lead, iron, zirconium). The unique sorption properties of the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent make it possible to aﬀ ord pure 90Y radiopharmaceuticals without employing the extraction method that is complex in hardware implementation. At the ﬁ rst stage of the process, selective sorption of 90Y from weakly acidic media is carried out on a phosphate cation exchange resin, where the main part of 90Sr is separated and passed into the ﬁ ltrate. Desorption of 90Y from the phosphate cation exchange resin with 3 M HCl and then 90Y sorption from the hydrochloric acid desorbate on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent allow deep puriﬁ cation both from residual amounts of 90Sr and from chemical impurities of corrosion products. Elution of 90Y from the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent is easily carried out with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, which is the preferred medium for obtaining 90Y-based radiopharmaceuticals.

Using the equilibrium shift method, it was shown that ytterbium and lutetium are recovered by the cation exchange mechanism in the form of the Ln[HA2]3 adduct up to 3 M HNO3, and with a further increase in the concentration of nitric acid in an aqueous solution, the separation mechanism changes to a solvate one. The separation factors β(Lu/Yb) in the studied separation systems are 1.4–1.6.

Context: Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a therapeutic radioisotope, which is widely used for medical purposes due to optimal nuclear-physical parameters: a convenient half- life (T1/2 = 6.7 days); acceptable energy of β-particles (maximum energy 0.5 MeV), which allows destroying small tumors and metastases 1–3 mm in size without aﬀ ecting healthy tissues; soft γ-radiation emission with energy suﬃ cient to visualize and track drug migration in the patient’s body (Eγ = 113 keV (6.4%) and 208 keV (11%)) [1, 2]. The decay product of 177Lu is the stable isotope 177Hf. In addition, 177Lu has chemical properties suitable for protein labeling (e.g., dotatate peptide [3]) with bifunctional chelating agents [4]. The main method for producing a high speciﬁ c activity 177Lu preparation is neutron irradiation of the starting material containing 176Yb [5]. Irradiation of an ytterbium target highly enriched in the 176 isotope is advantageous since in this case, due to the β–decay of the 177Yb, a monoisotopic product, 177Lu, is formed. Thus, the problem of obtaining an isotopically pure target product is reduced to its separation from the target material by chemical methods. The separation of Lu from Yb is a diﬃ cult task, since both elements are lanthanides and are similar in their physicochemical properties. Therewith, even a small amount of impurities of stable isotopes of lutetium at a level of several tenths of a mass fraction can lead to a signiﬁ cant decrease in the speciﬁ c activity of 177Lu. Taking into account the rather short half-life of 177Lu, the separation should be carried out using highly selective methods: extraction or chromatography [6]. Chromatographic separation is usually employed to produce chemically pure individual elements, but such a process is unproductive: concentration to prepare fractions up to 1 g/L is diﬃ cult to enhance productivity [7].

The separation of Lu from Yb is a diﬃ cult task, since both elements are lanthanides and are similar in their physicochemical properties. Therewith, even a small amount of impurities of stable isotopes of lutetium at a level of several tenths of a mass fraction can lead to a signiﬁ cant decrease in the speciﬁ c activity of 177Lu. Taking into account the rather short half-life of 177Lu, the separation should be carried out using highly selective methods: extraction or chromatography [6]. Chromatographic separation is usually employed to produce chemically pure individual elements, but such a process is unproductive: concentration to prepare fractions up to 1 g/L is diﬃ cult to enhance productivity [7].

Context: Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a therapeutic radioisotope, which is widely used for medical purposes due to optimal nuclear-physical parameters: a convenient half- life (T1/2 = 6.7 days); acceptable energy of β-particles (maximum energy 0.5 MeV), which allows destroying small tumors and metastases 1–3 mm in size without aﬀ ecting healthy tissues; soft γ-radiation emission with energy suﬃ cient to visualize and track drug migration in the patient’s body (Eγ = 113 keV (6.4%) and 208 keV (11%)) [1, 2]. The decay product of 177Lu is the stable isotope 177Hf. In addition, 177Lu has chemical properties suitable for protein labeling (e.g., dotatate peptide [3]) with bifunctional chelating agents [4]. The main method for producing a high speciﬁ c activity 177Lu preparation is neutron irradiation of the starting material containing 176Yb [5].

Context: 2-Ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) is a promising extractant in the REE production, since systems based thereof have higher separation factors of lanthanides [14]. The task of the extraction method is to separate 177Lu as fast as possible because of the short half-life, from the main mass of ytterbium, ensuring the most convenient subsequent handling of the recovered lutetium.

Context:  phase and to Eq. (2), as well as indirectly conﬁ rms the participation of P507 dimer molecules in the formation of compounds with REE. It is known that the use of heavy ﬂ uorinated diluents, for example, F3, also leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients; therefore, it was of interest to study the eﬀ ect of this diluent on the REE extraction with P507 solutions. The nature of the relationship between the REE distribution coeﬃ cients and the HNO3 concentration in the extraction of Yb and Lu with P507 solutions in F3 does not depend on the nature of the diluent (Fig. 3), however, the inﬂ uence of the solvation mechanism starts to manifest itself somewhat earlier (from 3 M HNO3) than in the case of extraction with Р507 solutions in isopar M. The curve of the distribution coeﬃ cients of ytterbi- um and lutetium vs. the P507 concentration in isopar-M constructed in logarithmic coordinates (Fig. 4) have a linear form with a slope close to 2, and not to 3, which may be a consequence of an increase in the degree of association of extractant molecules with a growth in its concentration. This fact leads to a decrease in the REE extraction constants with a rise in the P507 concentra- tion (Table 1). The concentration equilibrium constants of Eq. (5) turned out to be the same for isopar M and F3, therewith for lutetium they turned out to be lower than for ytterbium.

Reduction of the P507 concentration can be considered as an alternative variant, however, it leads to a decrease in the productivity of the process, since the saturation of the extractant decreases. At a P507 concentration of 15% (0.45 M), the maximum saturation of the extract with ytterbium tends to 0.075 M (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the molar ratio of REE : P507 = 1 : 6 in the organic

Context: Figure 5 shows the linear relationship between the logarithms of the equilibrium constants (2) and (5) and the logarithm of the relative Р507 concentration. The values of the slope coeﬃ cients a and the values of the parameters log K0 calculated by the least squares method are presented in Table 2. Unfortunately, the derived log K0 values were found to be diﬀ erent for these two diluents, which did not allow reducing the number of parameters used. The almost parallel behavior of the curves of the REE distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the P507 concentration and the HNO3 concentration indicates that the separation factors of Yb and Lu will slightly rise with a decrease in the extractant concentration remaining in the range of 1.4–1.6 (the separation factors were derived as the ratio of the experimentally found distribution coeﬃ cients from solutions containing Yb and Lu in diﬀ erent proportions). With an increase in the HNO3 concentration in an aqueous solution, the solvate mechanism of REE extraction begins to play an increasingly important role resulting in a decrease in separation factors.

Context:  It is known that the use of bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) as an extractant instead of P507 leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients by approximately 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining high values of the separation factors [20, 21]. Therefore, it was of interest to study the regularities of Yb and Lu extraction with solutions of Cyanex-272 in isopar M. In contrast to the system with P507, the functions of the logarithms of the Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration at a concentration of less than 1 M in this system have a slope of about –2.5 (Fig. 6), which results in the need to apply for simulation of the REE extraction in this region not only Eq.

Context: The slope of the function of REE distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the Cyanex-272 concentration in isopar M at 1 and 3 M HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 7) is close to 1.6, which corresponds to the cumulative proceeding of reactions (2), (5), (8), and (9). The slope coeﬃ cients a and the parameters log K0 of Eq. (7) presented in Table 1 evidence that the values of the parameters a of Eq. (7) practically do not diﬀ er for Yb and Lu, which notices that the separation factors of these elements are independent of the extractant concentration. The equilibrium constants of Eqs. (5) and (9) for Yb and Lu coincide and practically do not depend on the extractant concentration, which conﬁ rms the decrease in the separation factors of these elements at HNO3 concentrations above 2 M. At a lower concentration, the separation factors of the Yb/Lu pair increase and reach 1.4–1.6, which makes it possible to consider this extractant as an alternative to P507. At the same time, the low saturation of Cyanex-272 (Fig. 2) necessitates the use of Cyanex-272 only in a mixture with other extractants. The average error in calculating the distribution coeﬃ cients according to the model does not exceed 7–8 rel %.

The separation factors of lutetium and ytterbium in the studied extraction systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained experimental data on the extraction of lutetium and ytterbium with P507 were used to construct a mathematical model that makes it possible to predict the behavior of Yb and Lu in the extraction cascade.
