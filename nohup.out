Answer:  The target material is the 64Ni.
 Context: The separation of the 64Ni was performed by using an anion exchange column. The column was packed with a strong anion exchange resin. The column was eluted with 6 M HCl. 

Answer: 

The 64Ni target was dissolved in 6 M hydrochloride acid, and then the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components. The 64Ni was washed out with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling.
