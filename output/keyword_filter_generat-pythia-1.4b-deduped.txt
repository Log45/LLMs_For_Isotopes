Context: Abstract—Extraction systems based on extraction of tetraﬂ uoroboric acid (HBF4) with tributyl phosphate (TBP) and triamylphosphine oxide (TAPO) for boron isotope separation were studied. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid was studied in comparison with boric acid (H3BO3). The extraction isotherms at 20°C for four systems (boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids extracted with TBP and TAPO in o-xylene) were obtained, and single-stage isotope separation factors for these four systems were determined. The lighter boron isotope (10B) is concentrated in the aqueous phase in the systems containing tetraﬂ uoroboric acid, whereas in the systems with boric acid it is concentrated in the organic phase.

In such process, the enrichment factor α reaches 1.030 [2].

Context: Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) such as trialkyl phosphates and trialkylphosphine oxides can be used as extractants. Trialkyl phosphates are well known as eﬀ ective extractants and are used for recovering many acids and salts, whereas trialkylphosphine oxides have been studied in this respect to a lesser extent, and their extracting and separating power is of large interest. To reach the maximum eﬃ cient isotope separation by liquid extraction in a multistep process, the substance distribution ratio should be as close to 1 as possible. The distribution ratio D is described by the equation

Context: Vigorous progress of such ﬁ elds as nuclear power engineering, medicine, and instrument making makes it necessary to develop and produce specialty materials enriched in certain isotopes of various chemical elements. In particular, the boron isotope 10В, which has high cross section of thermal neutron capture, is a valuable constituent of many materials. For example, materials based on 10B are demanded in nuclear power engineering, namely, in reactor control and protection systems and in production of steel for transportation racks and containers for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Boron-10 is used in neutron capture therapy for cancer treatment. High demand for materials enriched in 10B and insuﬃ cient scale of their production make it topical to search for, study, and develop more eﬃ cient and environmentally safe procedures for boron isotope separation. Methods based on chemical isotope exchange, when isotope eﬀ ects inﬂ uence the properties of complexes of the extractive compound and extractant, are candidate separation methods. The “anisole process” is the most known and eﬃ cient among such methods. It is based on the reaction of gaseous BF3 with anisole CH3ОC6H5 to form the complex CH3ОC6H5∙BF3(l). This complex

Context: isotope composition were prepared by dilution of the initial solutions of boron-containing components (boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids) to a boron concentration of 1–5 mg/L. In the case of tetraﬂ uoroboric acid, it was subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of CaCl2 to remove ﬂ uoride ions interfering with the analysis. As organic diluent for the extractants we chose o-xylene, because this diluent prevents the third phase formation in extraction systems and favors fast phase separation, in contrast to aliphatic diluents such as dodecane. Prior to use, o-xylene was washed four times with equivalent amounts of distilled water. Chemically pure grade boric and tetraﬂ uoroboric acids were used without additional puriﬁ cation. Tartaric acid was recrystallized from water and dried; the melting point after the puriﬁ cation was 167°С. Tributyl phosphate was puriﬁ ed as described in [7]. Triamylphosphine oxide (TAPO) chosen among trialkylphosphine oxides was puriﬁ ed as described in [8].

Context: We determined the distribution ratios for each extraction system. The highest distribution ratio D is reached in the HBF4–TAPO system: 1.5 at low acid concentrations. High distribution ratio D is an advantage in commercial separation of boron isotopes, because at one extraction step the larger fraction of the substance is extracted, and thus the amount of the enriched product obtained increases.

Context:  Since the isotope separation in extraction systems directly depends on the constants of the transfer of substance isotopomers from the aqueous phase into the organic phase, it seems necessary to determine the factors directly inﬂ uencing the substance distribution between the phases. Boron- containing substances that are well soluble in water and are extracted into the organic phase should be used as extractable substances. We consider boric acid H3BO3 and tetraﬂ uoroboric acid HBF4 as such substances. Boric acid as a weak acid cannot be eﬃ ciently extracted into the organic phase without additional complexation; therefore, tartaric acid is added to aqueous boric acid solutions. Tartaric acid converts boric acid into a complex that is a stronger acid interacting with the extractant more eﬃ ciently. Tetraﬂ uoroboric acid does not require such additives. It is interesting to consider organophosphorus compounds as extractants. Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is one of the most readily available and widely used commercial extractants. Along with TBP, mixed trialkylphosphine oxide Cyanex 923 is used for the recovery of metal ions. Despite their wide use for the extraction of metal cations, there are few data on extraction of boron-containing acids with them. Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) were studied as extractants for acids structurally similar to HBF4, i.e., for monobasic complex metal-containing acids HMHal4, where М is a metal and Hal is a halogen. The data presented in review [5] show that compounds of metals in oxidation state (III) (such as Ga(III), In(III), Tl(III)) are extracted in the organic phase to form ion pairs consisting of solvated proton and metal-containing anion. HBF4 can be assumed to be extracted by OPCs by a similar mechanism. Mishra et al. [6] report the results of the extraction of HFeCl4 with tributyl phosphate (D = 3–8) and mixed trialkylphosphine oxides Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 (D = 2–8). Khoroshilov and Ivanov [4] studied the boric acid– TBP extraction system in the context of separation of boron isotopes. They obtained the single-stage isotope separation factor α = 1.0067 ± 0.0035 at 20–22°С. In this system, 10В was concentrated in the organic phase.

Context:  also an advantage for the extraction, because it increases the distribution ratio in the system. We determined the single-stage isotope separation factors α for the four extraction systems. The isotope separation in the systems with H3BO3 is not so high, which may be due to a signiﬁ cant change in pH of the aqueous phase upon ﬁ rst contact and cessation of isotope separation in the second and further extractions. On the other hand, the enrichment in the systems with HBF4 is higher than in the systems with H3BO3.

Context: Variation of the extractants inﬂ uences the isotope separation not so strongly as the kind of the extractable substance does. The isotope separation factors in the HBF4-TBP and HBF4–TAPO systems are close and coincide within the uncertainty. The kind of the extractant inﬂ uences to a greater extent the degree of extraction of the acid from the aqueous phase into the organic phase than the isotope eﬀ ects. Studies of extraction isotherms have shown that the HBF4–TAPO system gives the highest distribution ratio despite the 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 n* aq ((cid:572)), mM Fig. 1. Isotherms of boric acid extraction with TBP and TAPO. (1) Extraction of H3BO3 with 0.5 M TAPO in o-xylene, (2) Extraction of H3BO3 with 1.5 M TBP in o-xylene. The extraction mechanism in each system was determined from the shape of the extraction isotherm. In the H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TBP, H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TAPO, and HBF4–TBP systems, the substance distribution is mainly physical. In the HBF4–TAPO system, the extraction occurs by the chemical mechanism with the chemical interaction between HBF4 and TAPO. The chemical interaction between the system components is 1 2

Context: 1.003 ± 0.008 (10В is concentrated in organic phase) 1.0067 ± 0.0035 [4] 1.001 ± 0.011 (10В is concentrated in organic phase) 1.006 ± 0.006 (10В is concentrated in aqueous phase) 1.004 ± 0.007 (10В is concentrated in aqueous phase) fact that the TAPO concentration in the organic phase (0.5 М solution in o-xylene) in all the experiments was lower than the TBP concentration (1.5 М solution in o-xylene). Thus, the use of TAPO as an extractant is more advantageous from the viewpoint of the reagent consumption. As we found, in the extraction of HBF4, 10B is accumulated in the aqueous phase in contrast to the systems with H3BO3, in which 10B is concentrated in the organic phase. Thus, it can be concluded that, among all the systems under consideration, the HBF4–TAPO is the most suitable system for the boron isotope separation by liquid extraction, because this system is characterized by the highest distribution ratio D, the most eﬃ cient reagent consumption, and relatively eﬃ cient isotope separation at a single stage.

Context:  The synthesis and study of the properties of superheavy elements (SHE) is one of the fundamental areas of modern nuclear physics. Research in this area is being actively carried out both in Russia and in nuclear centers of other countries (Germany, Japan, USA). Thanks to the work performed at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (Dubna) and RIAR, nuclear- physical properties of new elements with serial numbers 115, 116, and 118 were synthesized and examined. These nuclides were prepared by irradiating targets based on highly enriched isotopes 243Am, 248Cm and 249Cf with 48Ca ions. Target materials are subject to high requirements for purity, as well as the content of radioactive impurities, which include Pu, Am, Cm, Cf isotopes and ﬁ ssion products. RIAR has an active production of 243Am and 248Cm radioactive materials [1]. Americium-243 is recovered from irradiated Pu by separation and precipitation methods [2, 3]. Curium-248 is recovered from aged 252Cf by extraction chromatography using HDEHP-based sorbents. As a rule, trace amounts

Context: of impurities, including Cf and Pu isotopes, ﬁ ssion products, and corrosion products of construction substances (stainless steel), remain in the materials after standard puriﬁ cation methods. For preparing materials of pure transplutonium ele- ments (TPE), ion exchange is widely used in radiochem- ical practice. In ion exchange chromatography, the sepa- ration is based on the selectivity of the ion exchange resin with respect to the counterions of the mixture. When separating ions with very similar properties [for example, rare earth elements (REE)], most ion exchange resins exhibit almost the same aﬃ nity relative to ions close to each other. Separation of rare-earth elements by elution from a column containing a cation exchange resin with a solution of a strong, non-chelating acid is practically impossible, since their distribution coeﬃ - cients diﬀ er little from each other [4]. If you choose a chelating agent that, with the ions of the mixture gives complex compounds of various strengths, then success- ful separation of the ions becomes possible. The stron- ger the complex formed in solution by the counterion, the less this ion will be absorbed by the ion exchange resin. Thus, the separation completeness of the mixture

Context:  components can be enhanced. The chelating reagent α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (α-HIBA) and its salts (main- ly ammonium) are used in ion-exchange processes of intra- and intergroup separation of REE and TPE radio- nuclides of [5–17]. Cation exchange methods are used to separate REE and TPE radionuclides by elution with solutions containing α-HIBA and its salts. Strongly acidic styrene–divinylbenzene sulfonic cation exchange resins, such as Dowex 50W-X8, Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8, and a number of their other analogues, are utilized as sorbents [6, 10, 12–16]. As a rule, in the technique used [5, 6, 9–12], trivalent actinides are ﬁ rst adsorbed from a dilute (<0.5 M) HNO3 solution on a cation exchange + form, resin. Then the sorbent is converted into the NH4 and the actinides are eluted with a chelating reagent (α-HIBA). It was noted in [8, 14] that, without prelimi- nary conversion of the cation exchange resin to the am- monium form by eluating with an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, the released H+ ions have a strong inhibi- tory eﬀ ect on poorly sorbed elements, such as Cf. Anion exchange chromatography using a strongly basic anionite Bio-Rad AG X8 was chosen as a method for purifying Am, Cm from Pu impurities. According to the literature data, Pu(IV) sorption on strongly basic anion exchange resins is possible from nitric acid and hydrochloric acid media [18–20]. In nitric acid media, Pu(IV) can be sorbed starting from 1 M HNO3, 2– therewith the maximum concentration of the Pu(NO3)6 anion is reached at 7.7 M HNO3 [18]. Sorption of Pu on anion exchange resins is also possible from high concentration HCl solutions. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Pu(IV) increases monotonically with a rise in the HCl concentration and, starting from a 9 M concentration, exceeds 1 × 103 [19]. Under these conditions, Am(III) and Cm(III) are not retained by the sorbent. This work was aimed at developing regimes for the puriﬁ cation of Cm and Am from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as developing the regimes for the separation of Am and Cm and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by ion exchange chromatography.

Context:  for puriﬁ cation of Am/Cm from Pu and Fe. The initial solution was a mixture of radionuclides 59Fe(III), 240Pu(IV), 241Am(III), 244Cm(III) in 9 M HCl. To stabilize plutonium in the +4 oxidation state, H2O2 was added to the solution to a concentration of 0.1 M. The initial solution (5 column volumes, hereinafter c.v.) was fed to a column with a Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 sorbent (50–100 mesh) in the Cl– form (1 cm3column) at a rate of 1 mL/(cm2 min), then washed with 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2.

As a ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation stage, the Fe impurity was separated by sorption from 9 M HCl on Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (50–100 mesh). from Pu and Fe. Microamounts of Pu were separated from Am and Cm by sorption of Pu on a strongly basic anion exchange resin Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 (50–100 mesh) from 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2 [20]. Americium and curium are practically not sorbed by the resin under these conditions. Puriﬁ cation in a hydrochloric acid medium is recommended in the presence of Fe(III) salts, since it allows achievement of simultaneous separation of Am and Cm from Pu and Fe. The fraction of Am and Cm contains no more than 0.5% Fe and no more than 0.1% Pu. Behavior of 152Eu, 249Cf, 244Cm, 241Am in a mixture during stepwise elution with α-HIBA.

The dead volume VM required to calculate the volume distribution ratio includes the free volume of the column and the volume of communications between the eluent injection point and the column. The free volume of the column is taken to be 0.38 c.v., based on the data of [24] for the Dowex 50-X8 cation exchange resin (200–400 mesh). The volume of communications between the eluent injection point and the column was determined experimentally and was equal to 0.05 c.v. Thus, the dead volume of the VM is 0.43 c.v.

Context:  The results in Tables 1–4 show that with an increase in the α-HIBA concentration at the second stage of the stepwise elution process, the width of the chromato- graphic peak at the base diminishes and the number of theoretical plates rises, i.e., peak blurring is reduced. At the same time, the selectivity α and the resolution RS de- crease, i.e., the overlapping degree of chromatographic peaks increases. It was noted in [25] that two substances will be separated if the selectivity α > 1; for a satisfac- tory separation, RS must be equal to 1. The separation is considered complete if RS is equal to or greater than 1.5. Therefore, the Cm and Am separation, as well as their puriﬁ cation from Eu and Cf, is recommended to be carried out by stepwise elution with 0.1 M (pH 5.0) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the ﬁ rst and second stage, respectively. Puriﬁ cation of weight quantities 248Cm. The initial solution contained 26.6 mg (4.08 × 106 Bq) 248Cm, 2.60 × 10–2 mg (3.3 × 106 Bq) 241Am, and 2.38 × 10–3 mg (3.6 × 105 Bq) 249Cf. The radiometric methods used in this work show no Pu isotopes in the initial solution (the Pu content is below the detection limits), so the preliminary Pu separation on an anion exchange resin was not performed. A mixture of 248Cm, 241Am, and 249Cf radionuclides was separated on a column containing 10 cm3 of strongly acid Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange + form. The geometrical resin (200–400 mesh) in the NH4 parameters of the column are similar to the parameters

Context:  of the columns used when working with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am. The order of elution and the concentrations of α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions are similar to those used in experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am (Fig. 3). The content of 248Cm and 241Am and their distribution by fractions are shown in the output elution curves (Fig. 4). On the output elution curve of 248Cm (Fig. 4), the leading edge is more diﬀ use than in experiments with indicator amounts of this element (Fig. 3). Based on the data in [10], this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the distribution coeﬃ cient of Cm probably increases with a rise in its concentration. The relation- ship between the amount of a substance sorbed from the liquid phase and its concentration in this phase at a con- stant temperature is expressed by the sorption isotherm.

Context: Fig. 4. Output curves of elution of weight amounts of 248Cm (248Cm 26.6 mg, 241Am 3.3 × 106 Bq, 249Cf 3.6 × 105 Bq) with α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, pH 5.0. At low concentrations, the amount of sorbed substance is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase, and a linear sorption isotherm is observed (the distribu- tion coeﬃ cient does not depend on the concentration of the substance in the liquid phase). Each component of the zone moves at a constant rate, since the linear rate of its migration depends on the ﬂ ow rate of the mobile phase, which is set constant. The entire zone moves with the same rate, remaining symmetrical: the concentration of the component is maximum in the center of the zone and decreases symmetrically towards the edges. There- fore, the peak on the chromatogram is also symmetrical (Figs. 1–3). If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeﬃ cient is greater than for low concentra- tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra- tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm). As a result, the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred and the peak is asymmetric. Since the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred when Am and Cf are removed from Am and Cf (Fig. 4), it can be assumed that the Cm sorption isotherm has a concave character. For a concave isotherm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diﬀ use leading edge; the retained volume increases with increasing ion concentration. For the speciﬁ ed Cm weight, the following charac- teristics were experimentally determined: the retention volume V = 35.4 c.v., the width of the chromatographic peak at the base W = 6.1 c.v., the dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeﬃ cient D = 35, the number of theoreti- cal plates N = 539. Comparison with the experimental results with indicator amounts of 244Cm (Table 2) shows that the number of theoretical plates N decreased when purifying the weight amounts of Cm. The result ob- tained agrees with the data of [9], in which the eluative separation of Am and Cm on a sulfonic cation exchange resin with α-HIBA was studied. It was shown in [9] that with an increase in the initial loading of the column with the mixture to be separated, the chromatographic sepa- ration eﬃ ciency of Am and Cm decreases (the number N of theoretical plates decreases). Using the developed technology, for the ﬁ rst time at RIAR, a 248Cm radionuclide material with a radionuclide and chemical purity signiﬁ cantly exceeding the indicators of preparations obtained using standard technology was produced [1–3]. The characteristics of the 248Cm preparation are as follows: the content of ﬁ ssion products (an activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

Context: The regimes of Cm and Am puriﬁ cation from Fe and Pu impurities, as well as the Am and Cm separation re- gimes and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by ion ex- change chromatography were determined. It was estab- lished that the separation of Pu microamounts from Am and Cm can be carried out by its sorption on a strongly basic Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (50– 100 mesh) from 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2. The Am and Cm separation and their puriﬁ cation from Cf and Eu by cation exchange chromatography with the α-HIBA ammonium salt solution as an eluent were tested. The REE and TPE separation is carried out in the regime of stepwise elution with the α-HIBA ammonium salt so- lutions of 0.1 (pH 5.0) (ﬁ rst stage) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) (second stage) concentrations. At the ﬁ rst stage of the process, Cf is recovered; at the second stage, Eu, Cm, and Am are separated. In experiments with indicator amounts of 249Cf, 152Eu, 244Cm, 241Am, the characteristics of the chromatographic process of cation exchange puriﬁ cation were determined: the number of theoretical plates N, distribution coeﬃ cient D, selectivity (separation factor) α, resolution RS. It was noted that upon puriﬁ cation of weight amounts of Cm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diﬀ use leading edge, i.e., the concentration Cm corresponds to the nonlinear section of the sorption isotherm. With a nonlinear sorption isotherm, the blurring of chromatographic zones increases and the eﬃ ciency of the chromatographic column diminishes (the number of theoretical plates N decreases and the resolution of the Am and Cm peaks decreases), resulting in reducing the separation completeness of these elements Puriﬁ cation of weight quantities of 248Cm was carried out, and the 248Cm preparation was produced with the fol- lowing characteristics: the content of ﬁ ssion products (the activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤ 2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

For producing 203Pb, natTl was electroplated on copper backing as target and was bombarded by energetic proton beam. After bom- bardment, the target was dissolved in 1 M HNO3. Ion exchange, solvent extraction, and nanomagnetic ion-imprinted polymer methods were used for separating 203Pb from thallium. The separation efficiency of these methods was studied. γ-Ray spectroscopy was applied for evaluating 203Pb and others radionuclides. The separation efficiency was determined from the γ-ray spectra. The separation efficiency of the methods us- ing ion exchange, solvent extraction, and nanomagnetic ion-imprinted adsorbent was 98, 99.3, and 96.4%, re- spectively.

Context:  There are at least three criteria in choosing the ra- dioactive isotope for in vivo and in vitro tracer studies. The radiation should be easy detectable; the half-life of the radioisotope should be neither too short nor too long; and the cost of the radioisotope should be moder- ate [1]. Lead-203 has a very simple decay mode (Fig. 1). It decays by electron capture followed by emission of γ-rays with energies of 279 (81%), 401 (5%), and 680 keV (0.9%). 203Pb with a half-life of 52 h is poten- tially useful for clinical scanning. High specific activ- ity and radiochemical purity of 203Pb are important for radiolabeling. 1–5 mCi of 203Pb radioisotope contains a trace amount of lead, which is less than 0.1% of the normal daily lead intake [2]. There are a number of methods for the 203Pb production [2–5]. Lead-203 is produced from either mercury or thal- lium target. Natural mercury has six stable isotopes. Several radionuclides of lead and thallium can be pro- duced by bombardment of natural mercury with 3He or 4He particles. Separation of 203Pb using this method is very difficult. The use of enriched mercury as a target material could partially solve this problem, but the cost of the obtained 203Pb will be very high. Therefore, the preferred target material for the production of 203Pb is

Context: Materials and equipment. Thallium(I) sulfate (99.9%) was purchased from UCB (Union Chimique Belge). Lead nitrate was purchased from Fluka. Stan- dard 1000 mg L−1 solutions of lead and thallium were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. All the other chemi- cals were purchased from Merck. Cu backings were produced in our workshop. All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade and were used without fur- ther purification. Working solutions of Pb and Tl were prepared by diluting appropriate amounts of the stock solutions. A Hydro Ultrapure water purification system was used for making deionized water needed to prepare all the required solutions. An HPGe detector system (CanberraTM, GC1020-7500SL) in conjugation with a PC-based MCA and A Metrohm 827 pH meter was used. Target preparation. Natural thallium(I) sulfate (Tl2SO4), was chosen as the target material. High- quality thallium targets (70 μm) were prepared by elec- trodeposition of 1 g of Tl on 12 cm2 copper backings.

Context:  The total amount of 203Pb before and after separa- tion was determined in all cases by the region of inter- est (ROI) values. The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods. The irradiation yield is 2.2 mCi μA–1 h–1.

Context: Abstract—A method has been developed for isolation of 228Ac from aged samples of natural 232Th. Macroscopic amounts of the thorium bulk (20 g) were separated by its extraction by a solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions, with microamounts of 228Ra and 228Ac remaining in the aqueous phase. 228Ac was selectively extracted from the resulting solution by the method of extraction chromatography on a col- umn with RE resin sorbent, and 228Ra quantitatively remained in the 4 M HNO3 eluate. 228Ac was washed out of the column with 0.05 M HNO3, it could be used as a radioisotope for research purposes. After the accumulation of the daughter 228Ac the solution of 228Ra in 4 M HNO3 was repeatedly passed through an identical column. The resulting 228Ac was used in the study to examine its sorption on commercial and modiﬁ ed carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) instead of the diﬃ cultly accessible 225Ac. It is shown that the application of CNMs as carriers of actinium isotopes for nuclear medicine purposes is promising.

Context: the mother nuclide (T1/2 = 5.7 yrs) and the absence of long-lived daughter nuclide. The activity of 228Ra in the secular equilibrium with 232Th is about 1.6 kBq per gram of thorium nitrate. Therefore, with 228Ra isolated from gram amounts of thorium nitrate, 228Ac can be dayly extracted from the generator with activity suﬃ cient for carrying out studies, including those performed in vivo (several and tens of kBq). Various ways to separate Th, Ra, and Ac are known from the literature [4–10]. 228Ra and 232Th are, as a rule, separated via coprecipitation of radium and its extraction in various systems [4, 5]. Actinium and radium are separated by ion-exchange chromatography [6, 7], extraction [8], selective sorption [9], and extraction chromatography [4, 6,10]. In these studies, small amounts of 232Th or trace amounts of 229Th have been used. At the same time, there is no published information about isolation of 228Ac from large amounts of 232Th (tens of grams).

Context: Studies concerned with the possibility of targeted delivery of actinium examined the sorption of 225Ac on various supports in radiopharmpreparations. For example, it has been shown that it is possible to use liposomal carriers [11–14] or nanoparticles based on inorganic substances: LaPO4 [15–19], InPO4 [20], GdVO4 [21], and TiO2 [22]. At the same time, application of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) seems to be promising because of the important properties: potential biocompatibility of their separate forms, accessibility in industrial amounts, low cost as compared with vector molecules, and the possibility of varying their biodistribution upon an appropriate modiﬁ cation. However, the evidence about using CNMs as actinium supports is extremely scarce [23, 24]. In this context, the goal of the present study was to develop a method for quantitative isolation of 228Ac as a product of 228Ra decay from natural thorium, with their subsequent separation and using the isolated 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state to examine the sorption of actinium on CNM sample with varied structure and physicochemical properties.

Context: The puriﬁ ed 228Ac preparation was obtained in several stages. In the ﬁ rst stage, macroamounts 232Th and accumulated 228Th are separated from a mixture of their decay products (Fig. 1) via extraction of thorium by a 1 : 1 solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions. The choce of the extraction agent was governed by earlier studies [4] in which it was found that the best reagent among those examined for separation of 232Th from products formed in its irradiation by high-energy protons (and also of radium and actinium) is HDEHP, which extracts 232Th from nitrate solutions in a wide range of HNO3 concentrations [25–27]. The phases were vigorously agitated for 5 min, centrifuged, and then separated in a separating funnel. The extraction was performed three times, and the aqueous solution with 228Ra was passed, to be fuller puriﬁ ed to remove thorium, through a column with extraction-chromatographic sorbent LN (Triskem Int., France, based on HDEHP, particles size 100–150 mesh). The sorbent ﬁ rmly retains thorium in a wide range of HNO3 concentrations, with radium and actinium not retained by this sorbent at HNO3 concentrations exceeding 0.2 M [28]. The mixture of nuclides, remaining after the separation of thorium isotopes contains 228Ra (in which 228Ac accumulates) and also 224Ra (in equilibrium with other decay products, including gaseous 220Rn) and the stable 208Pb. A single-stage isolation of 228Ac from a mixture of this kind is a complicated task, and deep puriﬁ cation to remove 224Ra is necessary for obtaining the radiochemically pure 228Ac. For this reason, the

Context:  mixture was kept for one month till the complete decay of 224Ra. In the ﬁ nal stage, 228Ac was separated from 228Ra, 208Pb, and newly formed 228Th. For this purpose, a solution of 228Ra in HNO3 was evaporated to dryness in a glass ﬂ ask on an electric hot plate, dissolved in 4 M HNO3; and the solution was placed in a column with RE extraction-chromatographic sorbent (Triskem Int., France, based on carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide and tributyl phosphate) with volume of 2 mL. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by selective elution from the column: ﬁ rst, 228Ra was eluted with a 4 M HNO3 solution, and then 228Ac, in 0.05 M HNO3, with fractions collected each having a volume of 1 mL The purity of 228Ac was determined by registering its gamma- spectrum during three days. To perform experiments on sorption of actinium on CNMs, the 228Ac eluate in 0.05 M HNO3 was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in several mL of a phosphate buﬀ ered saline (PBS) with pH 7. Gamma-spectrometry. The content of thorium, radium, and actinium, in the samples was found by the gamma-spectrometry on a spectrometer equipped with a GR 3818 high-purity germanium detector (Canberra Industries, United States). Thorium was identiﬁ ed by the gamma-peak of 228Th with energy of 84.4 keV. The content of 228Ra was determined by using the additionally introduced gamma-emitting 226Ra (186 keV, 3.6%) obtained via dissolution of 226RaBr2 in 0.01 M HCl. 228Ac was determined from the lines at 338 (11.3%) and 911 (25.8%) keV. Characterization of CNMs. We used in the study the following commercial samples of CNMs: powdered detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) of UDA-TAN brand (Federal State Unitary Enterprise SKTB Tekhnolog, Russia), aqueous suspension of partly reuced graphite oxide (GO), and powdered multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Nanotekhtsentr OOO, Tambov, Russia). The morphology of CNM particles was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on a JEM-2100F/Cs/GIF instrument (JEOL, Japan). The speciﬁ c surface of the CNMs was determined by the method of thermal desorption of nitrogen in terms of the BET model. The content of impurity elements in the CNMs was found by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP- MS) (X Series 2, Thermo Scientiﬁ c, United States). The elemental composition of the CNM surface was determined by the method of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical, Great Britain). The hydrodynamic diameter of CNM particles in hydrosols was determined by the method of dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Red Badge, 633 nm) ZEN 3600 analyzer (Malvern Instruments, United States). Acid functional groups on the CNM surface were determined by potentiometric titration. The surface of the CNM samples was modiﬁ ed by the procedures described in [29, 30]. DNDs were oxidized in a 3 : 1 mixture H2SO4/HNO3 at 120°C for 24 h, and GO and MWCNTs were hydrogenated in the Ar + 10% H2 atmosphere at 800°C for 5 h. Study of the sorption behavior of 228Ac on CNM. In a study of the sorption of Ac(III) on CNMs, a 100-μL portion of a CNM suspension was placed in polypropylene test tubes with a cover, and 900 μL of the resulting solution of 228Ac was added. The test tubes were shaken on a TS-100 shaker (Biosan, Latvia), and after that the mixture was centrifuged on a CM-50 centrifuge (Eppendorf, United States) for 20 min at 18000 g. Then, the gamma-spectrum of the 228Ac solution was recorded, and the counting rate of an aliquot of the solution was compared with that for a reference sample. To determine the amount of desorption, to the solution and precipitate remaining in the test tube was added a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, with the content of BSA in the resulting solution being 40 g/L. The contents of the test tube were stirred up and placed on a shaker, after which the phases were separated by centrifuging for subsequent radiometric measurements.

Context: Development of a procedure for separation of radiochemically pure 228Ac from natural thorium. It was shown that 228,232Th is extracted with HDEHP from a 4 M HNO3 solution nearly quantitatively (99%), with no 228Ra extracted in this case. An additional puriﬁ cation of 228Ra remaining in the aqueous phase to remove thorium was performed by its passing through a column with extraction-chromatographic sorbent LN, with 99.9% 228Ra and not more than 0.01% 228,232Th contained in the eluate. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by the extraction-chromatographic method on the RE sorbent. It can be seen in Fig. 2, which shows a chromatogram, that 228Ra is quantitatively extracted in 2–5-mL fractions and 228Ac in 13–16-mL fractions. The ﬂ ow rate of the eluate was 1 mL/min, which makes it possible to separate 228Ra and 228Ac in 20 min. It was

Context:  Fig. 2. Extractive-chromatographic separation of 228Ra and 228Ac on RE sorbent in HNO3. Column volume 2 mL, diameter 0.7 cm. Fig. 3. Kinetics of Ac(III) sorption on CNM in PBS at 25°C, m/V ratio 100 μg/mL. found here that the yield of 228Ac is nearly quantitative (not less than 95% relative to the amount placed on the column), with the separation factor of 228Ra and 228Ac being 2.2 × 104. According to [31], 208Pb is eluted from the column together with 228Ra. Thus, we developed a method for separation 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state from large amounts of natural thorium. The isolated 228Ac can be used in scientiﬁ c studies, including in vivo experiments. It was found that, with the developed method implemented, the loss of 228Ra does not exceed 0.005% of the amount placed in the column. Therefore, the starting 228Ra preparation can be repeatedly used. For this purpose, the fractions from 1 to 9 mL were evaporated and again dissolved in 1 mL of 4 M HNO3. It was shown that the results are reproducible because 228Ac could be eluted from the generator we developed not less than 20 times. In a prolonged use of the solution of 228Ra, there occurs accumulation of 228Th occurs due to the decay of 228Ac, but 228Th is quantitatively sorbed on the column with RE in the process of separation of 228Ra and 228Ac [31]. It is supposed that the columns with the sorbent are intended for single use, and, therefore, 228Th does not contaminate the solution of 228Ac being prepared. In the many-years use of the generator, the extract of 232Th can be repeatedly used to extract 228Ra accumulated in it.

Context:  Atorvastatin is a representative of lipid-lowering drug family recognized as statins. It acts selectively in the liver as inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and cho- lesterol synthesis. It is chemically described as (3R,5R)- 7-[2-(4-ﬂ uorophenyl)-3-phenyl-4-(phenylcarbamoyl)- 5-propan-2-ylpyrrol-1-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acid [1]. The lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the radiolabeled complexes determines the binding aﬃ nity for hepatic transport proteins, the eﬃ ciency of their hepatocyte up- take, and the excretion pathways [2, 3]. Atorvastatin is taken up selectively into the liver (hepatocytes) via organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) [4, 5], excreted into the biliary system, and stored by the gallbladder [6, 7]. Atorvastatin is a lipophilic statin but is relatively hydrophilic compared to simvastatin and lovastatin, which makes it more hepatoselective and able to cross cellular membrane either by passive diﬀ usion and/or active carrier-mediated process [8, 9]. The liver-selective uptake and the tissue- speciﬁ c distribution of atorvastatin via organic anion transporters ensure high pharmacological eﬀ ect. In the liver, the statin drug undergoes Cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism [10–13]. The dominant active

Context: metabolites are 2-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid [14, 15]. Elimination of atorvastatin occurs from the systemic circulation through the liver via the bile into the feces and through the kidneys via the renal- urinary system [16–19]. Most of the hepatobiliary radiopharmaceuticals available for imaging are labeled with 99mTc. They exhibit identical pharmacokinetic properties in animals. They are eﬃ ciently removed from the blood by the liver and excreted into the bile. Moreover, they diagnose diseases of hepatocytic function and the functional status of the cystic duct and the gallbladder [6]. The mechanism of in situ oxidative radioiodination using chloramine-T (CAT), involving the formation of iodine monochloride (ICl), was elucidated [20, 21]. In weakly acidic media, CAT dissociates to ArSO2NCl– anion, which may react directly with iodide to form ICl. Subsequently the iodine monochloride (ICl) reacts with any position in the target molecule that can experience electrophilic substitution [20, 22]. Owing to the diﬀ erence in the electronegativity between iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and acts as a source of iodonium ion (I+). Therefore, aromatic electrophilic labeling with electropositive radioiodide usually proceeds in high radiochemical yield compared to 50% yield if molecular

Context: and HPLC. The inﬂ uence of the CAT concentration (3–75 mM), atorvastatin amount (25–200 μg), pH of the reaction mixture (3–11), and the reaction time (5–60 min) on the radiochemical yield was examined. The conditions were optimized in order to enhance the labeling yield. Radiochemical analysis. The radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin was determined by silica gel thin-layer chromatography (SG-TLC). Samples were spotted 2 cm above the lower edge of the strip (1 cm width, 13 cm length). TLCs were developed in a benzene : ethyl acetate mixture (7 : 3 v/v). The radiochemical yield was expressed as the percent ratio of the radioactivity of 125I-atorvastatin to the total radioactivity. The radiochemical yield was the mean value of three experiments. Puriﬁ cation and chromatographic analysis of the radioiodinated complex were performed on Agilent HPLC system coupled to a sodium iodide radiometric detector. A 10-μL aliquot of 125I-atorvastatin solution at the optimum conditions was injected into a reversed-phase C18 column (Waters, 150 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm) kept at 25°C and was eluted with a mobile phase that contained 0.05 M CH3COONa buﬀ er and CH3CN (40 : 60, v/v) and was adjusted to pH 4.0. Atorvastatin was detected by UV absorbance at 246 nm. The mobile phase was ﬁ ltered and degassed before use and was pumped at a ﬂ ow rate of 1.00 mL/min [30]. In vitro stability. The in vitro stability of the complex was evaluated by incubating 1 mL of the reaction mixture at 37°C for 24 h. Exact 2–30 μL aliquots were extracted and analyzed at various time intervals using TLC and HPLC to determine the percent content of 125I-atorvastatin. Lipophilicity (partition coeﬃ cient log P). The lipophilicity of 125I-atorvastatin was measured experimentally by adding 5 mL of n-octanol and PBS (50 : 50) to a centrifuge tube containing a 1 mL aliquot of the radioiodinated compound. The tube was shaken for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The two phases were separated before aliquots (500 μL) of each phase were removed and counted in a well-type NaI(Tl) γ-counter. The partition coeﬃ cient (log P) is the ratio of the radioiodinated compound concentrations in the octanol phase and PBS at equilibrium. The extraction was performed in triplicate.

Score: 47.91



Context:  Synthesis of 125I-atorvastatin was carried out by direct electrophilic substitution with no-carrier-added 125I (T1/2 = 60 days) under oxidative conditions in the presence of CAT. The presumable reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The TLC results show that radioiodide stayed near the origin (Rf = 0–0.1), while 125I-atorvastatin proceeded with the solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1). The radiolabeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.4% (n = 5). It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the puriﬁ cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin. These products might be accumulated in non-target organs. As we found, 125I-atorvastatin was stable for up to 24 h. The lipophilicity was determined by measuring the distribution of 125I-atorvastatin between n-octanol and

Context:  Fig. 4. (Color online) Radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin as a function of reaction time. suppressing the formation of electropositive iodine. Figure 4 shows how the 125I-atorvastatin yield depends on the reaction time in the range from 1 to 60 min. The labeling yield increased with time, reaching 94.3% in 30 min. An increase in the reaction time beyond 30 min led to a small decrease in the radiochemical yield due to side oxidative reactions, whereas shorter reaction time is apparently insuﬃ cient for CAT to fully react with iodide ions and generate the iodonium ions. water. The experimental log P of the labeled molecule (5.9 ± 0.3) was found to be higher than that of atorvastatin (5.4), which may be due to the attachment of iodine. Therefore, atorvastatin is eluted before radioiodinated atorvastatin on reversed-phase HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 1). The lipophilic characteristics of 125I-atorvastatin are important for predicting the uptake and excretion pathways, as hydrophobic radiopharmaceuticals are generally extracted via the hepatobiliary pathway (eﬃ ciently taken up from the blood by the liver, excreted into the bile, and stored by the gallbladder) and slightly via the renal route as it was demonstrated from the in vivo biodistribution studies. The structural and physicochemical link between the hydrophilic and lipophilic functional groups in 125I-atorvastatin is involved in the assessment of the binding aﬃ nity for hepatic transport proteins, the eﬃ cacy of their hepatocyte uptake, and the elimination rate.

Context: concentration. The radiochemical yield as a function of atorvastatin concentration is plotted in Fig. 2. With an increase in the amount of atorvastatin from 25 to 50 μg (0.45–0.9 mM), the radiochemical yield increased from 85 to 94.3 ± 1.4%. Further increase in the amount of atorvastatin beyond 50 μg had no eﬀ ect on the labeling yield; i.e., the amount of 50 μg is suﬃ cient to capture all the produced iodonium ions. Eﬀ ect of CAT concentration. The eﬀ ect of CAT concentration on the radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin is shown in Fig. 3. High radiochemical yield (94.3 ± 1.4%) was attained with an increase in the CAT concentration from 3 to 13 mM at pH 5 and 30 min reaction time. Further increase in the oxidizing agent concentration over 13 mM decreases the radioiodination yield due to the production of undesirable oxidation by- products as a result of denaturation and chlorination of atorvastatin exposed to high concentration of CAT for a relatively long time. Eﬀ ect of reaction time. Chloramine-T is a powerful oxidant, and it may cause oxidative damage of sensitive biological substrates or targets if overexposed. Therefore, the radiochemical reaction should be quenched by adding a reductant such as sodium metabisulﬁ te. It reduces hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion, thus

McPhee Received: 21 February 2017; Accepted: 11 April 2017; Published: 17 April 2017 Abstract: Copper-64 is a useful radioisotope for positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efﬁcient production of high speciﬁc activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efﬁciently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with speciﬁc activity up to 5.6 GBq/µmoL. It was further incorporated into modiﬁed monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: After irradiation of 5 h, the 64Ni target was dissolved in 6 M hydrochloride acid, and then the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components. The 64Ni was washed out with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling. Due to the elevated cost of enriched 64Ni, recycling of the target material for re-use could reduce the production cost of 64Cu, without sacriﬁcing the quality of subsequent 64Cu production. When the eluted was switched to 1 M HCl, the ﬁrst band coming out was co-produced cobalt radioisotopes (approximately 1 mL), and the second was the 64Cu, which was collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for further use. The separation process of 64Cu took about 2.5 h after irradiation.

Context: The 64Ni targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the enriched 64Ni (99.32%) solution prepared as described above. Electroplating of 64Ni was realized using a plating vessel of our own design and manufacture (Figure 1), where the Au disk was used as a cathode and platinum wire as an anode. The electrodeposition of 64Ni was achieved at 2.4–2.6 V and 15–25 mA with the platinum anode at ~1 cm from the Au disk electrode. This process took 48–72 h. The enriched 64Ni target was irradiated at 12.5 MeV (which decreased by Al) with 20 µA current on a Sumitomo HM-20 cyclotron (20 MeV) for about 5–7 h. 64Cu was produced from the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction.

Context:  – dilution of the initial solution; – determination of the 106Ru speciﬁ c activity in the SNF working solution, on the walls of the reﬂ ux condenser, in trap solutions, and in undissolved residue; – α,γ-spectrometric analysis of the SNF working solution to estimate the volume of the aliquot required for the chromatographic separation of fractions; Fig. 2. Scheme of the apparatus for dissolving the SNF sample irradiated as part of KETVS-7. – carrying out sorption separation of nuclides U, Pu, Am-Cm-rare-earth fraction for mass-spectrometric measurements of the isotopic composition; – repetition of the sorption separation of nuclides U, Pu, Am-Cm-rare-earth fraction in the presence of a complex label to measure their weight content. To determine the fuel weight at the ﬁ rst stage, the sample with the fuel element cladding was weighed. Upon completion of the fuel dissolution, the cladding was removed, washed, dried, and weighed. The fuel weight content in the sample was found from the diﬀ erence between the weight of the sample with the fuel element cladding and the cladding weight. The weight of the sample and fuel cladding after dissolution was found on an analytical balance AX 205 (Mettler Toledo) with a weighing error of ±0.25 mg. The dissolution of the fuel sample irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was carried out in an apparatus (Fig. 1) [4]. The ﬁ rst trap is designed to capture ruthenium released during the dissolution of the SNF sample, the second is to absorb iodine isotopes, and three alkaline absorbers are to trap 14C released in the form of carbon dioxide. The purging rate of the apparatus volume with air was 1.2 L h–1. The dissolution of the fuel sample irradiated as part of combined experimental fuel assembly KETVS-7 was carried out in a dissolution apparatus (Fig. 2). The purging rate of the apparatus volume with an ozone–air mixture was 1.2 L h–1, which corresponds to an ozone supply rate of 2.5 × 10–2 g h–1.

Context: the MNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1, and a series of model experiments to prove the completeness of the oxidation of various carbon forms to CO2 and the capture of the resulting carbon dioxide by alkaline traps [3], as well as the results of testing KETVS-1 for the content of iodine isotopes. After cooling the MNUP SNF solution to room temperature, the reﬂ ux condenser was replaced with a refrigerator, and part of the SNF solution was distilled oﬀ at a temperature of 110–120°C. The condensate was collected in a 50 mL volumetric ﬂ ask. The tritium content was determined in view of a preset proportionality coeﬃ cient (Kpr), which takes into account the tritium fraction that passed from solution to condensate. At a volume of the MNUP SNF initial nitric acid solution of 250 mL and a condensate volume of 50 mL, Kpr = 0.24 ± 0.02 [4]. The activity of 3H in the condensate solution and 14C in alkaline solutions of Petri absorbers was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The part of the SNF solution remaining after distillation was ﬁ ltered through a double cellulose “blue ribbon” ﬁ lter 11.0 cm in diameter with a pore size of 1–3 μm to separate the undissolved residue.

Context: Uranium was determined by the spectrophotometric measurement of the light absorption of the uranium com- plex with arsenazo III; plutonium, by α-spectrometry; and ﬁ ssion products, by the atomic emission spectral method. The testing procedure is described in detail in [2]. At the ﬁ nal stage, 8 M HNO3 solution (200 mL) was added to a ﬂ ask with an undissolved fuel cladding, and control dissolution was carried out at a temperature of 95–100°C for 5 h. Upon dissolution process completion the α- and γ-spectrometric analyzes of the solutions were performed after the main and control dissolutions. The analytical line energies of radionuclides, their yields, as well as the half-lives for calculating the speciﬁ c activities of radionuclides when calculating their volumetric activity in term of concentration, were taken from [7, 8]. The isolation and puriﬁ cation of elements was car- ried out using a combination of cation-, anion-exchange, and extraction chromatograpy. The techniques devel- oped at RIAR were taken as the basis for the separation of SNF components. The isotopic composition of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, and Cm was determined in the isolated fractions. The analysis procedure is described in detail in [2–6, 9–11]. Quantitative determination of the U, Pu, Nd content was carried out by repeating the procedure for their isolation in the presence of a complex label by isotope dilution with mass spectrometric ending. To ﬁ nd the fuel burn-up depth, the value of 148Nd accumulation and the total 145Nd and 146Nd accumulation were used as monitors.

Context: The control dissolution of the fuel cladding was carried out upon completion of the dissolution process and separation of the undissolved residue. According to the data of α- and γ-spectrometric measurements of solutions, the content of α-emitters in the control solution is (3 ± 0.3) × 10–3% of their amount in the initial solution, content of γ-emitters is 0.1 ± 0.01%. The results of determining the burn-up depth, 3H, 14C, 106Ru speciﬁ c activities in MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor, in comparison with the results, which we obtained earlier for MNUP fuel irradiated in the BOR-60 reactor, are presented in Table 3. The discrepancy between the results of determining the tritium speciﬁ c activity is due to diﬀ erent types of reactor plants and fuel composition irradiation modes, as well as the degree of 3H diﬀ usion through the fuel cladding. Studies [13, 14] state that one of the main factors determining the tritium speciﬁ c activity in SNF is the fuel temperature at the irradiation time. As the temperature rises, the tritium content in the fuel composition diminishes. It was shown in [14–16] that tritium formed during SNF irradiation diﬀ uses through the fuel element cladding by 95–99%. Our data on the tritium speciﬁ c activity in the fuel cladding agree with the results of [17], where the tritium speciﬁ c activity in the fuel cladding with uranium oxide fuel and burn-up of 6.6–7.1% was 1.2 × 105 Bq/g. At the same time, it was found in [18] that the tritium content in the fuel element cladding of the VVER-440 reactor has a signiﬁ cant spread and is in the range from 3.9 × 106 to 3.4 × 107 Bq/g. The authors note that the uneven distribution of tritium is observed both along the height and along the circumference of the fuel-element cladding. They conclude that the main part of the tritium enters the cladding through areas of a damaged protective zirconium oxide ﬁ lm. From data presented in Table 3, it can be seen that the burn-up values of the MNUP SNF samples and the 14C speciﬁ c activity in them change symbatically. With increasing in the burn-up of the analyzed SNF sample by 23%, the 14C speciﬁ c activity increased by 25%. In the course of SNF dissolution, ruthenium is distributed over all elements of the dissolution apparatus: it partially remains in the SNF solution, condenses on the inner walls of the dephlegmator and connecting hoses, water cooler, enters the solution of the ﬁ rst Petri absorber containing the HNO3 solution, passes into the condensate solution produced at the tritium speciﬁ c activity determination stage, remains in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF.

Context:  be 8.2 × 103 Bq, and the 129I speciﬁ c activity will be 41 Bq/mL. For radiochemical studies of SNF samples, a hundredfold dilution of the initial solution is utilizsed. We failed to determine the 129I content in a dilute solution against the background of other SNF components. For detecting iodine, it is necessary to develop special procedures for its isolation from a SNF sample. The results of determining the isotopic composition and weight content of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, Cm in the MNUP SNF are given in Table 4. In parentheses are the values of the total absolute error in units of the last digits of the result for a conﬁ dence level of 0.95. When ﬁ ltering the MNUP SNF solution through a double cellulose ﬁ lter, a light gray coating was observed on the upper ﬁ lter. The sediment weight could not be ﬁ xed, since the initial weight of the cellulose ﬁ lter turned out to be greater than the weight of the ﬁ lter with sediment. This experimental fact is probably associated with the destruction of cellulose under the action of α- and γ-emitting nuclides. According to the data of [19–21], the sediment weight upon uranium oxide SNF dissolution in nitric acid is no more than 0.6% of the dissolved fuel weight. It was found in [22] that, upon dissolution of irradiated mixed-oxide fuel with a burn- up of 31.7 to 54.7 GW/t in 3 HNO3 at 95°С, the the undissolved sediment weight does not exceed 1.3% of the SNF weight. When studying the dissolution of model nitride SNF [23], the volumes of 7.8 and 9.44 M HNO3 required for dissolution were calculated based on the nal concentration of metals in the solution: 280 and ﬁ 400 g/L, respectively. It is shown that the weight of the undissolved residue is 1.8 and 2.26%, respectively. The results of detecting the content of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the solution and the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 5. The presence of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr was registered only on the upper cellulose ﬁ lter; there were no these elements on the lower ﬁ lter. The content of these elements in the solution obtained after the dissolution of the upper ﬁ lter was equivalent to their content in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF. The total weight of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 was 0.0019 g, which is 0.07% of the dissolved SNF weight. The results of determining the uranium and plutonium content in the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 6. The data in Table 6 indicate that the U and Pu contents in the upper and lower ﬁ lters are comparable. The close values of these quantities evidence that most of the U and Pu we found in solutions after the dissolution of the lters were sorbed by cellulose. ﬁ The excess of the U content in the upper ﬁ lter compared to the lower ﬁ lter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds. The weight of undissolved U estimated from the diﬀ erence between the U weight on the upper and lower ﬁ lters, is 2.5 mg, or 0.09% of the total uranium content in the analyzed SNF sample.

Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradi- ation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

Context: Cobalt-55 production was reported in 1938 from alpha irradiation of manganese [18] and has since been reported from many target materials and incident beams. Practically, two reactions are best suited for producing activities of cobalt-55 with few impurities: 58Ni(p,α)55Co and 54Fe(d,n)55Co, which are accessible on low energy cyclotrons [19]. These reactions have been thoroughly and recently reviewed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and signiﬁcant independent efforts resulting in recommended excitation functions for the reactions discussed below [20]. The 58Ni(p,α)55Co reaction has been employed by many groups [14,21–24]. Sev- eral radioisotopic and radionuclidic impurities can be formed in this process. Cobalt-57 (t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 1377 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is produced from 58Ni(p,2p)57Co above 15 MeV [23], and production of cobalt-56 occurs above 25 MeV [25]. Nickel-57 (t1/2 = 35.68 h, β+ = 44%, Eγ= 1377.6 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is primarily produced via the 58Ni(p,2p)57Cu, which decays to nickel-57 with a half-life of 196 ms [21]. This reaction occurs above the threshold of 12 MeV, and is useful for monitoring separation efﬁciency during process development. However, nickel-57 decays to cobalt-57, which cannot be separated from cobalt-55. Natural nickel targets can also be used, but result in increased impurities that limit downstream clinical work [26]. Cobalt-55 can also be produced by the 54Fe(d,n)55Co reaction [27]. Theoretically, this method affords radioisotopically pure cobalt-55 compared with the proton-induced route described above, avoiding cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Practically, purities are limited by the achievable enrichment of the iron-56 target. The excitation function peaks near 7 MeV (Figure 1) [28]. Finally, manganese-52m is also coproduced via the 54Fe(d,α)52mMn reaction, which has a threshold energy of 4 MeV [28].

Context: In Figure 2, “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the iso- mer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. The isomers cobalt-58m and cobalt-58g are co-produced in any charged particle irradiation. While the production of cobalt-58g is unavoidable, other radioiso- topic impurities can be reduced with careful modulation of proton energies and target material enrichments. The 58Fe(p,2n)57Co (t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 122.1 keV, Iγ = 85.6%) and 58Fe(p,3n)56Co (t1/2 = 77.2 d, β+ = 19.5%, Eγ= 846.8 keV, Iγ = 99.9%) nuclear reactions have a higher energy threshold than 58Fe(p,n)58Co, seen in Table 1 below [40].

Context: Deuteron bombardments can be used to produce cobalt-58m from enriched iron-57 via the (d,n) reaction, natural iron targets via the (d,n) reaction on iron-57 (2.2% abundance) or (d,2n) reaction on iron-56 (91.7%). Higher stopping power for deuterons reduces the quantity of isotopically enriched target material required, and deuteron-induced reactions’ excitation functions are often higher than similar reactions incited by proton beams. How- ever, the relative thermal power density deposited in the target by the deuteron beam is higher than for protons. Accelerators with deuteron beams are also less common, and where they do exist, they usually have energies too low to utilize the entirety of even (d,n) excitation functions. Deuteron irradiations to produce cobalt-58m proceed on iron isotopes iron-57 and iron-58, which both exist in relatively low abundance, so as with proton irradiations, signiﬁcant costs are associated with target materials. As in Figure 2, in Figure 6 “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the isomer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. Figure 6 above plots the excitation functions of natFe(d,xn) reactions that form cobalt-58m/g and enriched iron-57 can be used to increase yields and purities. Using lower-energy deuterons reduces the likelihood of the 57Fe(d,2n)57Co reaction occurring, which has a threshold energy of 3.9 MeV [40]. Overall, an enriched iron-57 target reduces radioisotopic impurities within the cobalt-58m sample. The possible 57Co-producing reactions excitation functions are shown in Figure 7. Sudar and Qaim examined the production ratio of the ground and metastable isomers of cobalt-58 from deuteron irradiations of natural iron targets [29] based on the assumptions that deuteron capture and iron-58 target reactions’ contributions are small, but to our knowledge, no measurements have been made of the formation of cobalt-58m/g using separated iron-57.

Context:  Figure 12. Excitation functions for the production of cobalt-58 from (α,n) reaction (a) and cobalt-57 (b) on manganese- 55 [29,30,32,35,78–84]. In addition to charged particle-induced reactions, several alternative and less prag- matic routes to cobalt-58m can be contemplated, e.g., quasi-monoenergetic neutron or triton irradiations. Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons can be produced via 2H(d,n)3He re- action on hydrogen-2 gas targets. The neutrons bombard nickel or cobalt induce the 58Ni(n,p)58mCo and 59Co(n,2n)58mCo reactions [29,75]. Tritons can be generated via the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction within a nuclear reactor with an energy of 2.736 MeV. These ions go on to bombard [56Fe]Fe2O3 targets to produce cobalt-58m,g via the 56Fe(t,n)58mCo reaction route [76,85]. These alternative reactions currently rely on rare accelerator infrastructure or on signiﬁcantly increased scale in terms of beam intensities. Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations. These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts. A com- parison of the experimentally determined thick target yields and theoretical yields are shown in Figures 13–16. Figure 13. Thick target yield comparison between theoretical data and experimentally collected data for iron-54 targets at (a) 8.2 MeV and (b) 12 MeV [26,86,87].

Context:  Figure 16. Thick target yield comparison between theoretical data and experimentally collected data for iron-58 targets at 10.1 MeV [87]. As mentioned above, the co-production of cobalt-58g with cobalt-58m is unavoidable. Valdovinos et al. determined that through the 57Fe(d,n)58gCo production route, cobalt-58g has an experimental yield of 131.5 ± 19.7 KBq/µA-h at 8.2 MeV with integrated currents ranging from 90 to 124 µA-h [26]. This impurity poses an issue to the application of cobalt- 58m due its long half-life and concomitant gamma emissions [88]. However, cobalt-58g can be useful for PET imaging of the biodistribution of radiolabeled agents. This potentially allows for determination of these agents’ biodistribution at timepoints many days after injection [89]. A summary of the discussed pragmatic production methods is shown in Table 2 below, highlighting the isotope produced, material needed with respective natural abundance, the reaction that must occur, and the possible radio-contaminants that may be co-produced.

Context:  Using the table above, it can be suggested that for the production of cobalt-55, iron-54 targets should be utilized based on the lack of potential long-lived radio-contaminants co-produced, and an increased yield at lower thickness targets when compared to yields produced by nickel-58. To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelera- tor capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

Context: Targets of nickel and iron are relatively easy to fabricate; most literature reports describe electrochemical preparations because of the thermal and electrical conductivity of the resulting metal deposits, and presumably due to their compatibility with efforts to reuse costly separated materials. Nickel powder, natural or enriched, can be plated onto a silver or gold backings via electrodeposition with ﬁnal deposited nickel masses between 45 and 200 mg [14,26]. The procedure follows closely to the methods for plating nickel-64 for the production of copper- 64 [90,91]. In a generally representative process, nickel-58 powder is dissolved in 6 M HNO3, dried and reconstituted in 2.3 mL of 2.4 M H2SO4. The plating solution is adjusted pH 9 using 28% NH4OH and 270–300 mg of (NH4)2SO4 and transferred to a circular elec- troplating cell that consists of a Teﬂon base that is connected to the gold coin, allowing for a 5 mm plating diameter [26]. With graphite or platinum anodes, a DC voltage of 2.5–3.6 V is applied, producing currents ranging from 8 to 116 mA. Masses of 45–55 mg are deposited in ~12 h and larger masses (100–200 mg) take 2–3 days to quantitatively electroplate onto the cathode [14,26] leaving a clear and colorless electrolyte behind. Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 µL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell. Thisgaard et al. explains a different method for electroplating iron powder, adapted from Zaman and Qaim [28]. In this method, iron powder is dissolved in 1 mL of H2SO4 under nitrogen-atmosphere. once dissolved, the solution is diluted with distilled water to 5 mL in order to have a pH of 1.5. This solution is then used for the plating process on a silver backing, where the current density is reported as 28–35 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h with a ﬁxed voltage of 7.3 V. [87]. Another form of target fabrication is to press elemental enriched iron into 5 mm diameter pellets. Enriched iron material can come in the form of Fe2O3. If made from the oxide form, the target will have poor thermal conductivity. Therefore, the enriched Fe2O3 is reduced to elemental form by heating the powder at 800 ◦C for 4 h in a hydrogen tube furnace [86].

Previously reported separation methods to remove nickel from cobalt used the AG 1 × 8 anion-exchange resin [14,24]. These methods included the use of multiple grams of resin packed into a glass column and equilibrated with 9 M HCl. The dissolved target solution in 9M HCl was loaded onto the column where the nickel elutes from the column in the eluate and 9M HCl wash in 10–40 mL. The cobalt-5x, which remains on the column during the large 9M HCl wash, is eluted from the column in 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl. The eluted cobalt fraction can then be evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in various matrices for further analysis and/or radiolabeling experiments. Anion-exchange chromatography also isolates cobalt-5x from iron target material [94]. After dissolving the target in acid, the iron is oxidized into the 3+ state with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of loading the cobalt-5x on to the anion-exchange resin and washing away the target material, as was performed in the nickel/cobalt anion-exchange separation, cobalt and iron are retained on the column when loaded. The cobalt can then be eluted form the anion-exchange column in 4 M HCl. The iron target will remain on the column during the 4 M HCl wash, but can be recovered in low concentrations of HCl. The HCl eluant containing cobalt-5x can also be evaporated and the cobalt-5x reconstituted in alternative matrices without incurring signiﬁcant losses [26,28,86,87]. Separation of cobalt-5x from manganese is similar to the isolation of cobalt-5x from nickel targets, but can use even less concentrated acidic media. As summarized by Bate and Leddicotte in “The Radiochemistry of Cobalt”, manganese in a dissolved target solution passes through a AG1 × 8 anion-exchange resin in HCl concentrations > 4.5 HCl. Once the target material is removed, the column can be washed with <4.5 M HCl to elute cobalt-5x [94].

Context: As stated by Valdovinos et al., it is preferrable to use extraction chromatography instead of traditional ion exchange resins to increase separation yield and purity level [26]. This realization allowed for the implementation of N,N,N(cid:48),N(cid:48)-tetrakis-2-ethylhexyldiglycolamide (DGA Branched extraction resin). The most recent published separation methods from both nickel and iron targets of varying enrichments use branched DGA to chemically isolate radioactive cobalt.

Context:  The separation of cobalt-5x from iron-5x uses a two column technique, as shown in Figure 18. An AG1X8 anion-exchange resin packed column is used for the bulk separation of iron and cobalt, then a DGA column serves as a “clean up” to further improve the puriﬁcation of cobalt-5x [26]. While there has not been a publication speciﬁcally on the separation of manganese target material from cobalt-55,58m, the work performed by Pourmand et al. suggests branched DGA can also be used for radio-chemical isolation using 4–6 M HCl, where in this range manganese 2+ has minimal afﬁnity for the resin, and cobalt 2+ has a greater afﬁnity [95].

Context: While not widely used for radiochemistry, early studies showed that cobalt can be separated from iron 3+ and nickel 2+ with the use of inorganic and organic absorbents [94]. Many of the inorganic separations were using alumina, a polar column chromatography absorbent [96]. The organic separations from iron 2+ and nickel 2+ rely on columns of 8-hydroxyquinoline, naphthaquinoline, and cupferron mixed with potato starch or dimethylglyoxime compound columns, as reported by Bate and Leddicotte, [94]. 5. Applications of Cobalt-55,58m 5.1. Free Cobalt-55 Free cobalt in the form of cobalt 2+ has been found to behave in the body similarly to calcium 2+ [97]. This has been found to be especially useful in tissues damaged by ischemia as these tissues contain high levels of intracellular calcium [98]. [55Co]CoCl2 PET has been used to image areas of the brain affected by ischemic stroke, showing that [55Co]CoCl2 uptake is inversely correlated to relative cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) [99].

Context: The somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are a family of 5 G protein-coupled receptors that contain somatostatin-binding extracellular domains [101]. Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102]. Variations of somatostatin have been developed to bind to the SSTRs for the detection and treatment of cancers. These analogs deviate from the base structure of SST in ways that increase binding speciﬁcity and plasma stability [103]. The first agent approved for PET imaging of SSTR2 was [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE (Netspot) in 2016 [104]. Since its approval, there has been interest in developing a PET agent for somatostatin receptor imaging with a longer half-life than gallium-68 to simplify patient logistics and to image longer time courses post injection with improved clearance from blood and non-target tissues. In a study published in 2008, Heppeler et al. investigated the effect of changing the metal ion on the afﬁnity of DOTATOC for SSTR analogs and compared their results to those published by Reubi et al. [105,106]. They found that Co-DOTATOC has higher afﬁnity than DOTATOC labeled with gallium and yttrium as well as octreotide [106]. Biodistribution studies of [57Co]Co-DOTATOC in mice with AR42J tumors revealed high (25% ID/g) tumor uptake at 4 h post injection (PI), even higher than the kidneys which are a clearance route for peptides. However, the tumor to kidney ratio did not increase at the 24 h timepoint. Crystallography with Ga- and Co-DOTA revealed similar pseudooctahedral geometry but differing charge states which may explain their differing binding afﬁnities [106]. This work led to a proof-of-concept study radiolabeling DOTATOC with cobalt- 55,56,58m [14]. In this study, the authors produced Co isotopes using the following reac- tions: 54Fe(d,n)55Co, natFe(p,x)56Co, and 58Fe(p,n)58mCo. They measured molar activities of >4 MBq/nmol for [58mCo]Co-DOTATOC and >0.21 MBq/nmol for [55Co]Co-DOTATOC, but [56Co]Co-DOTATOC wasnwas not examined [16]. Thisgaard et al. followed this work with a comparative in vivo evaluation of 57Co- labeled DOTATOC, DOTANOC, and DOTATATE with [111In]In-DOTATATE [107]. In a head-to-head comparison in AR42J cells, the three 57Co-labeled somatostatin analogues were found to have between 49 and 123% higher cellular uptake as compared to [111In]In- DOTATATE. All agents showed similar levels of nuclear translocation, with less than 10% of nuclear translocation observed up to 3 h post addition. The cell-killing abil- ity of the Auger emitter [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was also compared to the beta emitter [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE and the Auger emitter [111In]In-DOTATATE. At low concentra- tions, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was more effective in causing DNA damage than 111In- labeled or 177Lu-labeled, while at higher concentrations the [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE was most effective. When the cell-killing assay was normalized to cumulative decays, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was consistently most effective at all concentrations tested. The authors attributed the limited degree of cell killing demonstrated by lutetium-177 to the cells being grown in monolayer, which restricts the ability of the emitted electrons to cross into adjacent cells to do damage. The superiority of 58mCo-over 111In-labeled DOTATATE may also be attributed to the higher binding afﬁnity of the cobalt-labeled DOTATATE for SSTR2. Similarly to the 2008 study, the authors performed a biodistribution study with [57Co]Co-DOTATATE and found high tumor uptake 1–4 h PI. By 4 h, most uptake in organs with SSTR2 expression such as the stomach and pancreas had greatly decreased [106].

Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popu- lar imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist pep- tides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding afﬁnity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding afﬁnity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110]. The ﬁrst cobalt-55 imaging of GRPR was reported in 2016 by Dam et al. [111] and compared 55Co-, 57Co-, and 68Ga-labeled GRPR agonist NOTA-AMBA (NOTA-Gly-4-ABz- Gln-Trp-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) in a PC3 prostate cancer. 57Co- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA-AMBA were found to have similar receptor afﬁnities, serum stabilities, and phar- macokinetics at 1 h and 4 h PI [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA enabled PET imaging at a 24 h timepoint (and beyond) which is not possible with [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-AMBA and revealed encouraging clearance of the tracer and stable late uptake of [5xCo]Co-NOTA-AMBA in the tumor [111]. In 2017, Mitran et al. reported radiolabeling GRPR antagonist RM26 (NOTA-PEG2- [D-Phe, Sta, Leu] bombesin [6–14]) with cobalt-55 and cobalt-57 [13]. Cell binding and internalization were investigated in PC3 cells and a mouse PC3 xenograft tumor model. They observed 12% cell internalization at 24 h which is similar to what has been reported for [111In]In-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 [112]. Biodistribution studies in PC3 tumor-bearing mice showed that at 3 h PI the tumor uptake was greater than uptake in any other organ including the kidneys. PET imaging studies using [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 showed clear tumor uptake at 3 h PI and by 24 h PI the tumor showed high uptake (Figure 20). The IC50 for Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (5.54 ± 0.4 nM) [10] is approximately 10-fold higher than Co-NOTA-AMBA (0.46 ± 0.20 nM) [13,111]. In vivo comparisons between [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA and [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 are complicated as the early imaging times are not matched between studies. However, comparison at the 24 h timepoint shows greater uptake of [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA than [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 in the tumor as well as many other organs. Even though the tumor uptake was less, the tumor to organ ratios for [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 were sometimes 100-fold greater than what was observed with [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. This was most notable in tissues with high GRPR expression such as the colon, pancreas, and stomach. The 24 h PI PET images provided, with both papers similarly showing lower non-target organ accumulation with the [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 than with [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. Recently, Mitran et al. investigated the impact chelator modiﬁcation had on PEG2- RM26 cell binding, internalization, and biodistribution in PC-3 prostate cancer [113]. PEG2- RM26 was bound to NOTA, DOTA, NODAGA, or DOTAGA and radiolabeled with cobalt- 55 and cobalt-57. The NOTA- and DOTA-labeled peptides showed the highest uptake in PC-3 cells in vitro and DOTA-labeled peptide had the highest tumor uptake in vivo by 24 h PI. In PET imaging studies, NOTA and DOTA PEG2-RM26 showed near-complete clearance of the radiotracer from the kidneys and GI tract by 24 h, whereas NODAGA and DOTAGA had residual GI and kidney uptake respectively.

Context:  (NODAGA tagged) [121]. In vitro and in vivo up uptake waweres evaluated in the KB cervical cancer cell line which expresses high levels of FR [122]. The two agents had similar uptake and biodistributions, achieving >15% ID/g in xenografted tumors and underwent renal clearance [121]. Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu- labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124]. Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of speciﬁcity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difﬁcult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.

Context:  Further investigation into the ZHER3 afﬁbody involved modifying the chelator to determine if imaging qualities could be improved [135]. In addition to NOTA, which was used previously, DOTA-, NODAGA-, and DOTAGA-tagged ZHER3 were 57Co labeled. In vitro assays showed nearly equal, blockable binding of the afﬁbody conjugated DOTA, NODAGA, and DOTAGA. The measured equilibrium disassociation constants, KD, were 0.2 nM for DOTA and DOTAGA constructs and 0.1 nM for the NOTA and NODAGA con- structs. Interestingly, the internalization fraction of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 in DU145 cells was observed to be 5% over 24 h, while their previous study showed as compared to 50% in their previous study [134]. In vivo, [57Co]Co-(NOTA/NODAGA/DOTA/DOTAGA)- ZHER3 were compared at 3 h and 24 h PI. The DOTA- and DOTAGA-conjugated afﬁbod- ies showed more rapid blood clearance than those labeled with NOTA and NODAGA. [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was compared to [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 at 3 h post injection and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was followed to 24 h (see Figure 21 below). At 3 h, [68Ga]Ga- NODAGA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor uptake but lower blood, liver, and small intestine uptake. By 24 h, [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor to organ ratios as 68Ga at 3 h PI [135]. Figure 21. Chemical structures and charges of studied cobalt-chelate complexes (A). SPECT/CT images of the [57Co]Co- HEHEHE-ZHER3-X afﬁbody with NOTA, NODAGA, or DOTA chelator (B). For each agent tested, the later imaging timepoint produced better tumor contrast. PET/CT of [68Ga]Ga-HEHEHE-ZHER3-NODATA was only possible to 3 h PI and showed greater kidney accumulation (C) [135]. The anti-HER2 [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C and anti HER3 [57Co]Co-ZHER3 afﬁbodies showed promising tumor uptake, rapid blood clearance, and good imaging properties in the models tested. They would very likely translate well for labeling with 55Co for PET imaging. As a potential therapeutic, a 58mCo-labeled HER2/HER3 afﬁbody may not show signiﬁcant internalization needed for effective therapeutic response.

Context: Abstract—The possibility of producing 225Ac and 223Ra by irradiation of natural 232Th with medium-energy protons was examined. Thorium foils were irradiated with 90-, 110-, and 135-MeV protons at the accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Troitsk (Moscow oblast). The cumulative production cross sections for 225Ac were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, and for 227Th (223Ra precursor), 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. Based on the experimental data and theoretical calculations, the possible yields of 225Ac and 223Ra in irradiation of thick thorium targets at various accelerators were deter- mined. An efficient procedure was suggested for isolating the products from the irradiated targets: 225Ac, by liquid extraction and extraction chromatography, and 223Ra, by sublimation from a thorium–lanthanum melt followed by thermochromatographic separation in metallic titanium columns and extraction-chromatographic isolation of radium. The procedure allows production of large (units of curies) amounts of radiochemically pure 225Ac and 223Ra, which is promising for wide use of these radionuclides in nuclear medicine.

Context: targets by their irradiation with fast or thermal neu- trons [7, 8], γ-quanta [9], or accelerated protons or other charged particles [10, 11]. The starting 226Ra is also difficultly available. In addition, radium targets of relatively large mass are dangerous in handling, which gives rise to serious problems in their wide application, especially in cases when radium regeneration from the irradiated targets is required. Another radionuclide promising for medicine is 223Ra (T1/2 = 11.4 days). It is directly used for therapy of bone tumor diseases [12]. It can also serve as a source of 211Pb (T1/2 = 36 min) in generators [13]. The common route to small amounts of 223Ra is its isolation from 235U decay products. Large amounts of 223Ra can be produced by irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reac- tor, followed by chemical isolation of the formed 227Ac (T1/2 = 21.8 years) decaying into 227Th (T1/2 = 18.7 days) and then into 223Ra. As already noted, irra- diation and processing of a radium target involve seri- ous problems.

Context: Fig. 1. Scheme of 225Ac isolation from irradiated thorium target. We believe that the most promising route of pro- duction of 225Ac, 223Ra, and some other important ra- dionuclides is irradiation of natural 232Th targets with medium-energy protons, followed by product isolation. In the early 1960s, Lefort et al. experimentally meas- ured the production cross sections of 225Ac and 223Ra from 232Th at a proton energy of 150 MeV [14], and Gauvin measured the 225Ac production cross sections at proton energies in the range 43–115 MeV [15]. Also, 232Th was irradiated with the aim of 225Ac pro- duction with 660-MeV protons at an accelerator in Dubna [16] and with 600-MeV protons at an accelera- tor in CERN [17]. The possibility of producing 225Ac from thorium by its irradiation with protons of the en- ergy lower than 40 MeV was noted recently [18], but no experimental data confirming this assumption were presented. On the whole, only limited information is available on optimization of production of various ra- dionuclides from a thorium target and on radiochemi- cal procedures for isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from irradiated Th and on their purification to remove other radionuclides. Up to now, 225Ac and 223Ra were not actually produced by this procedure. The major goal of this study was measuring the 225Ac and 223Ra production cross sections in reactions of Th with 90–135-MeV protons with the aim to opti- mize the conditions for production of large amounts of these radionuclides on the proton beam of the Moscow Meson Factory [Institute for Nuclear Research (INR), Russian Academy of Sciences, Troitsk]. In the course of our study, we developed efficient radiochemical procedures for isolating Ac and Ra in the radiochemi- cally pure state. It can be expected that wide use of 225Ac and 223Ra in medicine will allow in the future cardinal solution of the problem of treating many tu- mor diseases. Th irradiation. In irradiation experiments we used 10 × 10 mm2 pieces of 5-μm-thick Th metal foil. The foils were irradiated with a beam of accelerated pro- tons of energy 128, 143, and 158 MeV at the linear accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Rus- sian Academy of Sciences [19], at a beam current of approximately 5 μA. In the course of irradiation, tho- rium foils wrapped in aluminum foil were intensely cooled with a water flow. To decrease the proton en- ergy to 90, 110, and 135 MeV, graphite absorbers were arranged before the target. The accuracy in the proton energy determination was approximately ±2.5 MeV. The uncertainty was determined by the accelerator pa- rameters and by proton scattering as a result of their absorption by graphite and cooling water. The proton flux was monitored with Al and Cu foils by production of 22Na and 62Zn, respectively, whose production cross sections are known [20]. The foils after irradiation were withdrawn and sub- jected to γ-ray spectrometric analysis using a spec- trometer equipped with a HPGe detector with a beryl- lium window (Canberra GR 3818). 225Ac isolation. Actinium was isolated by the scheme shown in Fig. 1. The procedure consisted of the steps of liquid extraction and extraction chroma-

Irradiated Th metal foils were dissolved in concentrated HNO3, the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 3–8 M HNO3, and Th was extracted with two portions of 1–5 M TBP or 0.1–0.5 M TOPO solution in toluene [21]. After the Th extraction, the aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, concentrated HClO4 was added, and the solu- tion was evaporated to dryness to remove Ru isotopes. For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatogra- phy in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-di- (TRU- isobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) [11, 22]. After washing the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, Ac was eluted with the next 15 ml of 5 M HNO3, and the solu- tion was collected. For complete purification of Ac, the extraction chromatography was performed twice. The radiochemical purity of 225Ac was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry with a semiconductor PIPS detector (Canberra). 223Ra isolation. Chemical isolation of Ra from irra- diated metallic Th was performed by a gas-chemical method. For this purpose, a piece of irradiated thorium foil (3 mg) together with metallic La (280 mg) was placed in a crucible of metallic Zr. Addition of La (Тm = 918°С) leads to formation of a melt with Th (for Th, Тm = 1755°С), and in the liquid metal diffusion and, correspondingly, release of the sublimed micro- elements are considerably faster than in solid Th. The crucible was heated for 1 h in succession at 970, 1040, 1130, 1190, 1270°С in a stream of helium purified with a titanium getter (the heating temperature was determined with an accuracy of ±15°С). Radium and other radionuclides were deposited at the furnace out- let on tantalum collectors in the form of foils which were replaced when changing the heating temperature. In another experiment (Fig. 2), an irradiated tho- rium sample with metallic La was heated for 1 h at 1200 ± 15°С, and the released products were trans- ferred with a helium stream into a thermochroma- tographic column (quartz tube lined with titanium foil from the inside); the sublimed elements were deposited on the Ti surface in different temperature zones. After the heating completion, the titanium foil serving as collector for sublimed products was cut into pieces (corresponding to temperature zones), and the γ-ray spectrum of each piece of the collector was measured. After that, the piece of the collector with the deposited Ra, Ba, and Sr was subjected to further purification by

The elements were washed off from the surface of the titanium foil-collector with 7 M HNO3, and the resulting solutions were passed through an extraction-chromatographic column packed with the sorbent containing 4,4'(5')-di-tert-butylcyclo- hexano-18-crown-6 (Sr-resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.). Radium was eluted with a 7 M HNO3 solution. Under these conditions, Ra is washed out, whereas Ba and Sr remain on the column. The radiochemical purity of 223Ra was determined by γ- and α-ray spectrometry. To prepare specimens for α-ray spectrometry, a known aliquot of the solution was applied dropwise onto stainless steel disks. By this procedure, we prepared radiochemically pure Ac and Ra samples. Figure 3 shows the γ-ray spectra of the irradiated thorium target and of chemi- cally isolated Ac and Ra fractions.

Thus, the experimentally measured production cross sections are cumulative, and they cannot be accurate, because the production cross sections of the parent 225Th, 225Ra, 229Pa, and 225Ra were not determined sufficiently reliably. Never- theless, these cumulative cross sections allow estima- tion of 225Ac yields in irradiation of targets in different ranges of proton energy. The 225Ac production cross sections that we calcu- lated from γ-ray spectrometric data are plotted in Fig. 4 in comparison with the theoretical values obtained us- ing different models: ALICE (ALICE-IPPE version) and cascade evaporation (СЕF). For the proton ener- gies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, the experimental cross sections were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, respectively. Figure 4 also shows the experimental data obtained previously [14, 15]. Our experimental data lie between the theoretical data calculated by different models and better agree with the previous experimental data reported in [14], rather than in [15]. Figure 5 shows the 225Ac yields that we calculated for a thorium target in relation to its thickness and ini- tial (“inlet”) energy of protons incident on the thick target (the energy of protons leaving the target was taken equal to 40 MeV; below this energy, the 225Ac yield is extremely low).

As can be seen, it is more appropriate to produce 225Ac at proton energies exceeding 100 MeV. On the basis of the available experimental and theo- retical data (Table 2), we calculated the amounts of 225Ac that can be produced in one 10-day irradiation run at various accelerators: in INR, Brookhaven Na- tional Laboratory (USA), Los Alamos National Labo- ratory (USA), TRIUMF (Canada), and Arronax (France). The real beam current attainable at these in- stallations on thorium targets, taking into account the possibilities of their cooling, is given. The proton en- ergy decreases on passing through inlet windows, cool- ing water layer, and target shell, so the energy of pro- tons incident on the target (“inlet” energy) is usually lower by 5–15 MeV than the initial accelerated proton energy. Some installations use multilayer targets for better cooling, and certain energy loss is observed in water gaps between the target layers and in the shells (this loss was taken equal to 10%). The chemical yield was taken equal to 90%. The target was kept after irra- diation for 10 days in the case of 225Ac and 16 days in the case of 223Ra (the best time for accumulation from 227Th). As can be seen, the Ac yield monotonically in- creases with an increase in the proton energy, and effi- cient production is possible by irradiation of a metallic Th target with accelerated protons of the energy ex- ceeding 100 MeV. 227Th production cross sections and 223Ra yields. Theoretical calculations show that the major pathway of 223Ra formation is via α-decay of 227Th (Т1/2 = 18.7 days) produced by the (p,p5n) reaction and via

Context: β+-decay of 227Pa produced by the (p,6n) reaction. The contributions of the direct 223Ra production and its pro- duction via 223Fr and 223Rn are insignificant (<1%). The experimental cumulative production cross- sections of 227Th, determined in this study for proton energies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, are 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. In Fig. 6, these data are given in comparison with the results of calculations by two versions of ALICE code and by the СЕF model. The theoretical and experimental values are in reason- able agreement. Figure 7 shows the calculated 223Ra yields in irra- diation of a thorium target (irradiation for 10 days, cooling for 16 days, an optimal dime for the decay of 227Th into 223Ra).

Table 2. It is appropriate to produce 223Ra, like 225Ac, at accelerators with the energy exceeding 100 MeV and high beam current. Chemical isolation of Ac. The γ-ray spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of more than 80 radio- active isotopes of various elements in products of Th irradiation. Along with the desired 225Ac and 223Ra, other radionuclides are formed by fusion and spallation reactions and by the subsequent decay of the products of these reactions: 224Ra (Т1/2 = 3.7 days), 225Ra (14.8 days), 226Ac (29 h), 227Ac (21.8 years), 227Th (18.7 days), 228Th (1.9 years), 231Th (25.5 h), 228Pa (22 h), 229Pa (1.4 days), 230Pa (17.4 days), 232Pa (1.3 days), 233Pa (27 days), and 230U (20.8 days). It is important that irradiation of metallic Th is not ac- companied by formation of significant amounts of 222Rn (3.8 days), giving rise to serious technical prob- lems in the isolation of 225Ac and 223Ra from radium sources. Also, some fission products were detected in amounts comparable (in activity) with those of the de- Fig. 8.

The relative activity of 225Ac in the mixture formed was as low as ~1%, and that of 223Ra, several percents. Thus, isolation of radiochemically pure 225Ac from a complex mixture of radionuclides is a complex prob- lem. The process for 225Ac isolation from solution con- sisted of extraction and extraction-chromatographic steps. In liquid extraction, macroamounts of Th, and also Pa, Zr (>90%), I (>75%), and Nb (35–40%) pass to the organic phase, whereas the other elements, in- cluding Ac and Ra, remain in the aqueous phase. The results of extraction-chromatographic separa- tion of a number of elements in the carrier-free state are shown in Fig. 8. Washing of the column with 15 ml of 5 M HNO3 eliminates such interfering radionuclides as 136Cs, 105Ru, 140Ba, and 131I. The Ac fraction was eluted in the next 15 ml of the acid, whereas such in- terfering radionuclides as 141Ce and 140La remained on the column. We found that 225Ac was fully purified when the extraction chromatography was performed twice. Figure 3b shows the γ-ray spectrum of the iso- lated Ac fraction.

Chemical isolation of Ra. Radium-223 was iso- lated by a gas-chemical method used previously for isolating certain actinide, lanthanide, and alkaline- earth elements in the carrier-free form [23, 24]. The method is based on the fact that Ra in the metallic state is considerably more volatile than Th and a number of other interfering elements (Ac, Pa, La, Pm, Ce, Nd, Be, Cr, Zr, Mo, Nb, Tc, Sn, Ag, Ru, Rh). The addition of metallic La is extremely important. Thorium placed in a zirconium crucible together with metallic La dis- solved in liquid La in the course of heating, which en- sured fast diffusion of the microelements being iso- lated in the liquid metal and high degree of sublima- tion of Ra isotopes. The presence of metallic La also stabilizes the metallic state of nonvolatile elements (actinides, lanthanides, and also Sn) which could sub- lime at the experiment temperature in the form of vola- tile lower oxides from vessels made of Ti and Zr [25]. Lanthanum also binds into nonvolatile compounds Sb and Te, which under other conditions readily sublime at approximately 1200°С [26]. Special experiments showed that without metallic La the Ra sublimation yield decreased and some other interfering elements sublime, which makes the subsequent thermochroma- tographic separation less efficient. Heating of the irradiated metallic Th in the pres- ence of La for 2 h at 1200°С ensured release of more than 99% of radium isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, 225Ra), of Sr and Ba isotopes, and also of I, Br, Cd, and Cs, which are highly volatile in the elementary state. The ele- ments that exhibit low volatility in the elementary state (Ac, Th, Pa, U, Ru, Sn, Zr, Nb, Y, Mo, Ce, Pm, Nd), and also Sb and Te did not sublime and fully remained in the crucible. Figure 9 shows the temperature de- pendence of the release of various elements from a melt with La (the points characterize stepwise heating of the same sample at successively increasing tempera- tures, for 1 h at each temperature). The relatively low degree of the release of I can be accounted for by low rate of diffusion of large iodide ion in a Th–La melt. Figure 10 shows the distribution of the isolated ele- ments in the titanium thermochromatographic column. The deposition temperature of Ra, Ba, and Sr (maxi- mum of the thermochromatographic peak) under these conditions was 800 ± 30; that of Be, ≥1170; that of

Apparently, Ra, Ba, Sr, Be, Cs, and Cd are transported along the thermochromatographic column in the ele- mentary state, whereas I and Br form compounds with Ti. As can be seen, by depositing the sublimed ele- ments on the Ti collector in the temperature range 1100–600°С (the range is refined depending on the isolation conditions), it is possible to obtain a fraction of Ra containing only Ва and Sr impurities. The subsequent extraction-chromatographic purifi- cation of this fraction allows us to obtain a fraction of pure Ra containing 223Ra with impurities of 225Ra and 224Ra (Fig. 3c). Thus, we have developed an efficient procedure for isolating 225Ac and 223Ra from metallic Th irradiated with medium-energy accelerated protons.

In irradiation of the starting material with >98% enrichment for 6 months in the SM reactor with ther- mal neutrons at a flux density of 1 × 1015 n cm–2 s–1, the total yield of all the Cd isotopes is about 50% rela- tive to the initial silver weight; the specific activity of 109Cd is 4–4.2 Ci g–1. The production of the desired radionuclide is accompanied by the production of a significant amount of 110mAg. The subsequent radio- chemical processing of the irradiated sample is per- formed to remove 110mAg from 109Cd, obtain the re- quired chemical form of the product, and regenerate expensive 107Ag for the repeated irradiation. The 110mAg/109Cd activity ratio in the final product should not exceed 3 × 10–4%. Extensive experimental data are available on the separation of Ag and Cd by ion exchange, extraction, and selective precipitation of Ag [1, 2]. The over- whelming majority of methods are methods of analyti- cal chemistry, unsuitable for operation with gram amounts of Ag and Cd in hot cells under the conditions of remote control. Only the precipitation methods based on precipitation of poorly soluble silver halides or of Ag metal after the silver reduction are an excep- tion. We believe that the precipitation of Ag metal, which is a compact readily settling powder that can be readily washed, is the easiest in implementation. This method was used for isolation and purification of 109Cd [3]; silver was precipitated from 0.1–2 M HNO3 in the presence of NaNO3 on SKN carbon sorbent. At equal initial activity of 109Cd and 110mAg, the Cd/Ag separa- tion factor was approximately 500–800. Final purifica- tion of Cd to remove Ag was performed by isotope dilution of Ag, followed by the AgCl precipitation. In contrast to [3], in numerous procedures for re- covering Ag from wastes the reduction, as a rule, is performed in weakly alkaline or ammonia solutions, because specifically in these media it is most complete [4]. This study was aimed at developing a procedure for Cd purification to remove Ag in one process cycle by reduction and precipitation of Ag from ammonia solutions, followed by the Cd concentration in the form convenient for the subsequent preparation of the 109Cd product (hydrochloric acid solution with preset HCl concentration). We chose as reductant hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS), which does not react with Cd. The precipitated Ag metal is the ready starting product for fabricating targets. Then, Cd is precipitated from the mother liquor in the form of basic cadmium carbonate, which is then readily dissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this study, we determined the conditions for the most complete reduction of Ag and precipitation of basic cadmium carbonate from ammonia solutions.

Context: As seen from Eq. (1), the Ag and HAS ions react in the 2 : 1 molar ratio. For the successful removal of Ag from Cd, it is important to know at what excess of HAS the residual concentration of Ag in the mother liquor will be the lowest. Figure 1 shows the results of experiments on the influence of the HAS/Ag molar ratio on the degree of reduction (precipitation) of Ag in an ammonia buffer solution at рН 10. As seen from Fig. 1, at HAS/Ag = 0.5, i.e., at a stoichiometric amount of HAS, 0.014% of Ag remains in the mother liquor, which corresponds to a decrease in the Ag concentration by a factor of 7.1 × 103. At HAS/Ag ≥ 1, the Ag concentration decreases by a factor of 1 × 105. Influence of рН on the Completeness of the Ag Reduction Because the Ag reduction is performed in an am- monia solution, Ag and Cd occur in the form of am- mine complexes. Therefore, it is hardly probable that an increase in the ammonia concentration and hence in pH will influence the completeness of the Ag reduc- tion. On the other hand, determination of the lower pH limit is very important for performing the process effi- ciently. HAS contains 1 mol of sulfuric acid per mole of the salt. According to Eq. (1), the Ag reduction is accom- panied by the formation of 2 mol of hydrogen ions from 1 mol of HAS. Apparently, the buffer capacity of the initial ammonia solution should exceed the sum of the concentrations of hydrogen ions released in the reaction of silver with HAS and introduced with HAS.

Context: Fig. 2. Logarithm of the mother liquor activity as a function of pH of the Ag reduction (precipitation) at HAS/Ag = 2. precipitate and solution depends on the concentration ratio of metal, ammonium, and carbonate ions and molecular ammonia as a complexing agent. For the efficient separation of Ag and Cd, it is necessary to find conditions at which Cd would completely occur in the carbonate precipitate and Ag would occur in the solution the ammine complex. Apparently, the minimal concentration of ammonia should be sufficient for dissolving Ag and Cd nitrates with the formation of the corresponding soluble ammine complexes of Ag and Cd. The maximal concentration of ammonia should be so as to allow no less than 95% precipitation of cadmium carbonate.

Figure 2 shows how pH of the solution influences the degree of reduction (precipitation) of Ag in an am- monia buffer solution at the molar ratio HAS/Ag = 2. As seen from the above data, the best results are ob- tained when the HAS/Ag molar ratio is higher than unity and pH is higher than 6. Under these conditions, the weight fraction of Ag in the mother liquor does not exceed 0.014%.

Context: Figure 3 shows the dependence of the degree of the CdCO3 precipitation on the NH4OH concentration at different NH4NO3 concentrations. The concentrations of potassium and cadmium carbonates in all the ex- periments were constant and equal to 0.3 and 0.1 M, respectively. As can be seen, at an NH4NO3 concentra- tion of 0–0.6 M the ammonia concentration should not exceed 0.8 M to ensure no less than 95% precipitation of Cd. Thus, the procedure described in this study allows efficient separation of 109Cd from 110mAg in one proc- ess cycle with quantitative isolation of purified 109Cd.

Context: To take full benefit of excitation function and to avoid the formation of the radionuclidic impurities, the proton entrance energy should be 14 MeV.18,19 The physical thickness of the silver layer is chosen in such way that for a given beam/target angle geometry the particle exit energy should be 5 MeV. According to SRIM code (The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter);25 the thickness has to be 352 µm for 90° geometry. To minimize the thickness of the silver layer, a 6° geometry is preferred, in which case a 35 µm layer is recommended. Silver targets are prepared by DC-CCE (constant current electrolysis) of the metal from alkaline plating solutions. An electrolysis solution is a volume of about 450 ml and a composition of 5.1 g.l–1 AgCN, 5.1 g.l–1 KCN, 3 g.l–1 Na2CO3, while the current between the electrodes is adjusted to 0.05 A. The silver electroplating was performed in constant current. In 2 hours, a silver target of 36.75 mg.cm–2 thickness is prepared. Prior to the silver plating and to ensure a good adhesion, copper plate was cleaned using sandpaper of 1000 grade followed by rinsing copper plate with deionized water. Non-reactive plating vessels are hollow Perspex cylinders (diameter 6 cm, height 20 cm) fitted with an axial Pt anode wire mounted at the bottom by means of a tube-end fitting with perforated septum.

Context: Cadmium-109 has found application in physiological research on animals and plants for more than forty years informations. This which has provided useful radionuclide can probably be used for inhibition of liver cancerous cells,12,13 as well as for tissue imaging with computed SPECT (single photon tomography).14 Additionally, to investigate the ecosystem.15 emission it can be used The production of 109Cd with a proton beam can be performed by reactions: In+p,16 that needs an energy of about 96 MeV, Ag+d17 with energy 13.4 MeV and Ag+p,18,19 with an energy range between 14 and 9 MeV. Cyclotron is ideal for this work. Accelerator production of 109Cd is largely achieved via nuclear reactions 109Ag(p,n)109Cd and 109Ag(d,2n)109Cd which are well suited for medium to low-energy cyclotrons. Our centre in Karaj employs a Cyclone-30 (IBA, Belgium). Solid targetry systems on these accelerators are made of pure copper backing onto which target materials are electrodeposited. It is noted that silver electrodeposits prepared from nitrate solutions, free of any organic or inorganic additive, are not smooth or compact, regardless of plating condition used. They consist of grains growing independently of each other and under given plating conditions may degenerate as dendrites.20 Since most of the work directed at replacing cyanide in silver plating 0236–5731/USD 20.00 © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest

Context:  Four symmetrical windows (22.36 or 11.69 cm2) on the vertical side wall allow up to four copper targets backing positioning. Each slot is sealed by an O-ring fitted window. The geometrical shape of the slot determines the actual target electrodeposition area. The liquid-tight sealing of the windows is realized by stainless steel mechanical pestles mounted on a PVC ring surrounding plating vessel and by pressing the copper backing against O-ring seal. An external PVC ring is fitted with four supporting pins to hold a motor-stirrer combination in position. The stirrer is a hollow perforated POM cylinder mounted on the axis of a DC motor and surrounding the platinum anode. The stirrer rotation speed is set at 600 rpm; during the process, its rotating direction is reversed after 8 seconds improving deposit homogeneity. To keep the desired temperature at a preset level, a heater (a series of six isolated 1 Ω/W resistors, through which an appropriate DC-current is forced (1.1 A, 40 °C up to 1.8 A, 60 °C) is circularly mounted at the bottom of the vessel. An insulated sensor, introduced through the stirrer support-plate, temperature. As monitors electrolysis to depletion requires long-time (up to 24 hours) plating, evaporation of plating solution occurs. To maintain a constant liquid volume (450 ml), a conductivity glass/graphite sensor monitors the solution level and actuates a peristaltic pump at the required rate, supplying distilled water to compensate evaporation losses. The rack-mounted home-made electronics includes a motor/stirrer control, an adjustable DC voltage generator card and four V/I converters coupled to current boosters.

Context: The freshly prepared solution of silver was poured into the plating vessel. This refined procedure is a result of several repeated experiments with different acidity and compositions of bath, different temperature and electroplating currents. The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined in by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (using a Joel Model JSM 6400 at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV). The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C (the temperature that the Ag layer can experience during a high current irradiation) for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water.

Context: Silver is a relatively noble metal; most metals being less noble than silver form immersion deposits on the surface. This tends to happen even when the base metal enters the silver solution hot or live, that is, with a voltage already applied. The inevitable result of this phenomenon is poor adhesion of subsequent deposits. To minimize this effect, it is essential to employ a silver strike coating prior to the main deposit.21,24 In this work experiments were carried out on adhesion with and without strike coating. It was concluded that if the plating were carried out very rapidly, a good adhesion would be obtained in all electroplated targets without the need for strike coating. Embrittlement of metals has been recognized for many years but, as two authors have pointed out, some other defects in electrodeposits, such as blistering, cracking, gas pits, peeling off and poor adhesion, may also be related to hydrogen in ways not yet identified.26 Plating on a dietary or greasy surface inevitably leads to blistering or peeling of deposit. Cathodic cleaning in either acid or alkaline solutions provides large quantities of hydrogen for absorption.26 In all experiments, the substrate surface was cleaned with sandpaper of 1000 grade and immersed in the nitric acid bath of 0.3M. Then the surface was washed by water and its oil contaminators were removed by a mixture of the alkali cleaning powders. Finally, the surface was washed with acetone.

Context: The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The evaluation of quality of the layers was achieved by comparison of the photomicrographs in terms of size and form of the Ag nuclei and the extent to which they overlapped each other. The smaller, more spherical and the more overlapping nuclei were considered to be a good plating quality. The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water. Observation of neither crack formation nor peeling off of the silver layers indicated a good adhesion for the purpose. SEM photomicrograph showed that the granulometry of electroplated targets with current density of 8.54–12.82 mA.cm–2 were not as desired (Figs 1a and 1b). Hence, current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 was chosen and the SEM photomicrograph showed a suitable granulometry (Figs 2 and 3). The SEM photomicrograph of the best electrodeposition of these baths is shown in Fig. 3.

Context:  Abstract—Zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrices were prepared by mixing solutions of zirconium oxychlo- ride, selenous acid, and sodium molybdate in different manners. The elution of the generated 99mTc radioactiv- ity from the obtained zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrices was studied using small chromatographic col- umns of the matrix. 6 g of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix dried at 50°C, packed in a glass column (1.1 cm i.d.), was eluted by passing 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 and ambient temperature (~25°C). The 99mTc elution yield of 77.1% was obtained. Radionuclidic, radiochemical, and chemical purity of the eluate proved to be suitable for use in medical applications.

Context:  In nuclear medicine, 99mTc is the most frequently used radiotracer because of its suitable physical and nuclear properties. It emits monoenergetic (140 keV) γ-photon suitable for γ-cameras. In addition, its half- life of 6 h is suitable for performing the required tests without exposing the patient to unacceptable radiation dose. Planar cameras are used for bone scanning with 99mTc-MDP, and SPECT cameras are used for cardiac 99mTc-Sestamibi [1–7]. Cyclotron- scanning with produced 99mTc is not practical because of the high cost and short half-life [8–10]. The main source of 99mTc is the β–-decay (87.5%) of 99Mo (T1/2 = 65.94 h). Techne- tium-99m of high purity, suitable for medical applica- tions, is obtained by elution of radioisotope generators based on alumina columns loaded with fission 99Mo of high specific activity [11]. Other sorbents were also tested for preparing 99Mo/99mTc generators, such as silica gel, hydrous zirconium oxide, manganese diox- ide, and hydrous titanium oxide [12]. The main disad- vantage of these generators is the limited adsorption capacity of the base material for 99Mo, which, in turn, requires the use of 99Mo of very high specific activity (of the order of tens thousands Ci g–1), produced from nuclear reactors via fission route. Generation of high amounts of intermediate and long-lived fission product waste as a result of complex multistep separation and purification of fission 99Mo in expensive hot cells with sophisticated equipment and infrastructure are the

Context: main disadvantages of fission 99Mo radioisotope gen- erators [13]. Alternative technologies are required to overcome these drawbacks. These alternative technolo- gies are based on incorporating neutron activation 99Mo of low and medium specific activity (0.3– 3.5 Ci g–1 Mo) into insoluble precipitates of high Mo content such as Ce, Zr, Mg, Ti, Fe, Th, Sn, and Te compounds, which are then used as column matrices [14–28]. Post- and pre-irradiation-formed gels are the two common techniques used for preparing gel genera- tors. Isotope exchange allows overcoming the radiation degradation resulting from irradiation of the prepared gel material and the multistep procedure in pre- and post-irradiation-formed gel techniques, respectively [16, 29]. Solvent extraction of 99mTcO4 – or sublimation of 99mTc2O7 has also been used in some generator sys- tems for extraction of 99mTc from 99Mo of relatively low specific activity, produced by direct neutron acti- vation of molybdenum targets [12]. This study was aimed at preparing 99Mo/99mTc gen- erator based on zirconium selenomolybdate as a col- umn matrix by post-irradiation-formed gel technique.

Context:  Radiometric identification and measurements were made with a multichannel analyzer (MCA) of Inspec- tor 2000 model, Canberra series (the United States), coupled with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) coaxial detector of GX2518 model. A UV-160 A UV-VIS spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) was used for deter- mining Zr and Mo. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with an 18 kV diffractometer (D8 Ad- vance, Bruker, the United States) with monochromated CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). Elemental analysis was carried out with a BW-1200 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Philips, Netherlands). The morphology was examined with a JSM-6510A field emission scan- ning electron microscope (FESEM) (Japan). The IR spectrum was recorded with an MB157S FT-IR spec- trometer (Bomem, Canada) in the range from 4000 to 400 cm–1 at room temperature. Thermal analysis, in- cluding simultaneous thermal gravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal (DTA) analysis, was carried out with a DTG-60H device (Shimadzu, Japan). Radioactive 99Mo solution. 99Mo was obtained by eluting a 99Mo/99mTc generator with alumina-packed columns (Mon-Tek Generator, Monrol Nuclear Prod- ucts Industry and Trade, Turkey), loaded with 20 GBq on calibration date. Each column was eluted with a 2 M NH3 solution. The 99Mo eluate was passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter to retain any possi- ble alumina particles. The ammonium molybdate-99Mo solution was gently heated to dryness and then redis- solved in 0.1 M NaOH solution. Alternatively, for pre- paring 99Mo/99mTc generators, solutions of fission 99Mo (~100 mCi) in 0.1 M NaOH solution were obtained from the ETRR-II Radioisotope Production Facility (RPF). Then, 99Mo solution was diluted with 1.0 M HCl to the desired pH value. Preparation of zirconium selenomolybdate gel matrix. 0.25 M Mo(VI) solution was prepared by dis- solving 3.025 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O in a small portion of distilled water with the addition of 5 mL of a 99Mo solution along with a few drops of 30% H2O2. The re- sulting sodium molybdate solution was warmed to de- stroy excess H2O2 and then cooled to room tempera- ture before adjusting to pH about 4.5 with 2 M HNO3. The volume of the Mo(VI) solution was completed to 50 mL with distilled H2O. 0.25 M Zr(IV) solution was prepared by dissolving 5.062 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O in a small portion of distilled water and then was com- pleted to 62.5 mL, after which it was heated to 60°C and then left to cool to room temperature (~25°C).

Varied volumes of the three solutions were used to obtain different molar ratios. The pH of the solution for preparing the ZSM gel was adjusted to ~5.0 with 2 M Na2CO3. The precipitates formed were digested in the mother solution for 24 h at room temperature before phase separation by centrifu- gation. After separation, the precipitate was washed several times with distilled water until the washing filtrates were free from chloride ions, dried at 50°C for 24 h, and pulverized to the desired particle size.

Context: where A0 and AF are the radioactivities of 99Mo in the initial mixed solution and supernatant after separating the precipitated ZSM gel, respectively, measured under identical geometric and counting conditions. Elution of 99mTc from 99Mo-99mTc chroma- tographic columns. Unless otherwise stated, small chromatographic columns consisting of glass burettes of different internal diameter and containing different amounts of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix were used. The columns were conditioned for 99mTc elution by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solutions through the bed matrix and left for 24 h before elution. The columns were eluted 10 times with different flow rates (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mL min–1) over the course of 15 days (shelf life). The time between each two successive elution runs was 23 h. The 99mTc elu- tion yield was determined by comparing the counting rates of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum of the column directly before and after elution, taking the contribution of 99Mo to this peak into account [15]. The elution profiles were drawn for various elution flow rates. pH values of the eluate solutions were de- termined with a pH meter.

For dry elution studies, a stream of air was passed through the molybdate bed to keep it free from the in- terstitial saline solution for the next elution. Preparation of 99mTc generator based on zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel matrix. A glass col- umn (1.1 cm i.d.) was packed with 6 g of the zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel. The generator was conditioned for elution of 99mTc by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution through the column bed and then left overnight to be ready for the elution of the gener- ated 99mTc radionuclide. The 99Mo content in the eluate (99Mo breakthrough) was determined, in the case of its presence, as the con- tribution of the count rate of 181 or 739 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum to the total count rate. The γ-ray spectrum of the eluate was measured directly after elu- tion and after 3 days. The radionuclidic purity of the eluted 99mTc was determined as the contribution of the count rate of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum. The radiochemical purity defined as the percentage of 99mTc radioactivity present in the 99mTcO4 – form was determined by ascending paper chromatography using Whatman no. 1 chromatographic paper and 85% methanol as a developing solvent. The activity distri- bution along the chromatogram was determined with a γ-ray spectrometer, and Rf was calculated as the ratio of the distance (cm) traveled by 99mTc species from the starting line to the peak position to the distance (cm) traveled by the solvent from the starting line to the sol- vent front. The possible Zr, Mo, and Se impurities in 99mTc eluate were determined by ICP and/or UV-VIS spec- trometry. The zirconium selenomolybdate gel prepared under optimum conditions was characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TGA, DTA), XRD, XRF, and FESEM.

Context: gel matrix (ZSM-1) shows the presence of extra water molecules in addition to –OH groups and metal oxides present in the material (Fig. 1). The bands observed at 878 and 722 cm–1 may be due to metal–oxygen bonds, which are manifested in the range 650–1000 cm–1. The band at 1380 cm–1 belongs to bending vibrations of metal-bonded hydroxyl groups. The strong and sharp peak at 1617 cm–1 may be due to HOH bending vibra- tion. The absorption bands at 2900 and 3421 cm–1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of coordinated wa- ter [30, 31]. Figure 2 shows the TG and DTA curves of the zir- conium selenomolybdate gel. The first step in the TG curve between 40–200°C with the weight loss of 11.58% corresponds to the loss of physically adsorbed water and water of crystallization with an endothermic peak in the DTA curve at 125°C. The weight loss in the range 200–440°C was small (2.6%). An endother- mic peak observed at 500.6°C with the weight loss of 11.165% in the range 435–530°C can be assigned to the evaporation of SeO2 and coordinated water and to decomposition of hydroxyl groups. The weight loss in the range 600–900°C was 4.51%. The presence of suit- able amounts of water in the gel material is important to enhance the 99mTc diffusion through the gel material during the elution [32]. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dried zirconium selenomolybdate gel, which shows that it is amorphous. The amorphous structure is much better than the crystalline structure because of more efficient diffusion of the eluent through the amorphous material, increasing the elution yield. The SEM images of the prepared ZSM material at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the gel matrix has a porous basic structure, which makes it good material for diffusion of 99mTc during elution [33].

Context: Elution of 99mTc. Figure 5 shows how the internal diameter of the column and the amount of the matrix influence the 99mTc elution profile. As can be seen, large size of the bed matrix is the major factor influ- encing the 99mTc elution performance. The position of the maximum elution is displaced to higher eluate vol- umes with increasing inside diameter of the column (0.46, 0.6, and 1.1 cm i.d.), i.e., with decreasing height of the zirconium selenomolybdate bed. About 97, 86.2, and 69.9% of the eluted 99mTc radioactivity was eluted with the first 3 mL. The elution yield was found to be 83.3, 81.7, and 76.8% for 0.46, 0.6, and 1.1 cm inside diameter, respectively. The elution profiles of 99mTc from the 1.1 cm i.d. column containing different amounts of the molybdate matrix (1, 3, and 6 g) are shown in Fig. 6.

The broad and tailed elution profiles with increasing flow rate may be attributed to slow sorption/desorption kinetics of 99mTc. The elution yield was found to be 82.2, 81.7, and 78.3% at flow rates of 0.5, 1, and 2 mL min–1, respectively.

Context: Received June 10, 2005 Abstract(cid:0)The reaction cross sections and the energy dependences of the yields of 186Re in the reactions natW(d, 2n) and 186W(d, 2n) in the range of low deuteron energies (<14 MeV) were determined. The specific features of the physicochemical behavior of impurity 186Re atoms in irradiated tungsten cyclotron targets were studied in relation to the gas medium composition. The yield of the desired product increases with an increase in the oxygen content in the course of heat treatment of the targets. A simple (cid:0)dry(cid:2) procedure was developed for isolation of 186Re with a yield no less than 85% and radiochemical purity no worse than 99.99%. A proto- type of a cyclotron target for commercial production of the therapeutical radionuclide 186Re was suggested. PACS numbers: 25.45.-z DOI: 10.1134/S1066362206050171 Radioactive isotopes and ionizing radiation sources are widely used in science, industry, engineering, and medicine. In the past two decades, two major trends were steadily observed on the world market of radio- isotopes: decline in the use of fissile radioactive mate- rials and increase in the production of radionuclides for nuclear medicine [1]. Radionuclide therapy is an actively developing field of nuclear medicine. It has doubtless advantages over other kinds of radiation therapy because of low side effects, minimal damage of normal tissues, and possibility of treating metastases and disseminated tumors. Presently the annual volume of sells of radionu- clides for medicine and of radiopharmaceuticals in the United States (45% of the world market in this field) is about $700 mln. American marketing companies expect that by 2015 the annual volume of sells of radionuclides for medicine will increase to $4.5 bln, primarily due to increased production of therapeutical radioisotopes [1]. In the past 3(cid:0) 4 years, the efforts of the leading research laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL, etc.) are focused on the development of processes for production of certain radionuclides (47Sc, 89Sr, 131I, 153Sm, 186Re, 188Re, 213Bi, 211At), among which 186Re occupies a prominent place.

Context:  Cross section of the 186W(d, 2n)186Re reaction as a func- tion of deuteron energy: (1) this study, (2) data of [5], and (3) data of [6]. irradiated W powders, because a polymorphous transi- tion in W was discovered only in finely dispersed samples [17]). Heating of irradiated W above the polymorphous transition point (>1000 K) was accompanied by the release of 186Re into the gas phase; the release of the impurity atoms from the bulk of the metal became more active with an increase in the oxygen content in the medium in the course of heat treatment of the targets. In particular, when the irradiated cyclotron (cid:0)4 torr, the release of (cid:0)5(cid:0)10 targets were annealed at 10 (cid:0)2 torr it did not (cid:0)3(cid:0)10 186Re did not exceed 3%, at 10 exceed 15%, and when the samples (W/C composites) were heated in air, the release increased to 65% (typi- cal value for the majority of our experiments). This fact strongly suggests that, along with the emanation occurring at polymorphous transitions, there is some other process facilitating the release of radioactive microimpurities (in the form of volatile rhenium species ReO3, Re2O7) into the gas phase, e.g., their release in the course of cyclic gas transport reactions of the following type: oxidation of irradiated W metal with atmospheric oxygen (cid:7) sublimation of WO3 with the release of impurity 186Re atoms into the gas phase (cid:7) condensation of WO3 on graphite powder followed by its reduction to metal (cid:7) reoxidation of W metal, etc. We took this separation scheme as a basis for a (cid:3)dry(cid:4) process for 186Re production.

Context: Abstract—The conditions for the oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) and its reduction to Am(V) are shown, and the stability of these forms in a 0.1 M nitric acid model solution of the actinide-lanthanide fraction of high-level waste (HLW) containing isotopes of americium and curium and also praseodymium as a simulant of the behavior of fragmented lanthanides is deﬁ ned. It was found that about 30% of americium in the Am(V) oxidation state of its initial content in a model solution containing a salting-out agent (ammonium nitrate) in an amount of 8 M, passes into the organic phase in one stage of extraction with a 30% solution of tributyl phosphate in Isopar-M. In this case, Cm and Pr are extracted by 80–85%. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Am was about 0.1, of Cm and Pr, about 1, and the separation factor of Am from Cm and Pr was about 10. Thus, the possibility of selective separation of americium from HLW for its subsequent transmutation in fast reactors was demonstrated.

Context: americium into an independent fraction with followed its transmutation in fast neutron reactors [1]. Previously, we proposed a method for separating the actinide–lanthanide fraction from a highly active raﬃ nate during the extraction with TBP in an isoparaﬃ n diluent in the presence of iron nitrate as a salting- out agent [2]. In this case, one of the most important radiochemical problems is the subsequent separation of americium from curium and lanthanides. This separation is necessary for a number of reasons. First, the lanthanides are neutron poisons; some isotopes have a high neutron capture cross section, and their presence in the fuel will inhibit the transmutation of americium [3, 4]. Secondly, the involvement of curium isotopes in a closed nuclear fuel cycle is problematic, since it has a high level of neutron and thermal radiation, which will complicate the manufacture and operation of regenerated homogeneous nuclear fuel or americium targets for its transmutation.

Context: The well-known problem of separating Am, Cm, and lanthanides is caused by the similarity in their chemical properties [5, 6]. TPE and lanthanides are 5f- and 4f-elements, respectively, they are characterized by the ﬁ lling of internal f-orbitals with increasing atomic number, which has little eﬀ ect on the chemical properties that depend mainly on processes in the outer electron shells. In view of this fact, these elements predominantly exist in aqueous solutions in the oxidation state(III). The ionic radii of these cations are also comparable. Americium and curium ions have isostructural analogs in the lanthanide series: r(Nd3+) ≈ r(Am3+), r(Sm3+) ≈ r(Cm3+). Thus, it is diﬃ cult to separate trivalent Am and Cm from lanthanides by adjusting only the size of the coordination sphere of organic ligands. There are several approaches to the separation of Am from Cm and lanthanides, and most of them are based on extraction methods [7, 8]. The key diﬀ erence between these cations is that americium can be oxidized to higher oxidation states Am(V,VI), which changes its extraction behavior [9, 10]. Previously, in our works [11, 12], it was shown that, generating Am(VI) in weakly acidic solutions makes it possible to extract Cm(III) from their mixture using the extractants 1-phenyl-3-methyl- 4-benzoylpyrosolone-5 and trioctylphosphine oxide, while Am(VI), being reduced by the organic phase to Am(V), remains in the aqueous solution. At the same time, the use of these extractants in industrial conditions is challenging. For this reason, it was proposed [13] to use TBP as a reliable and well-tested extractant in the technology to solve the problem of separating Am from Cm. For example, curium was extracted almost quantitatively from solutions containing ≤0.1 M HNO3 and ~8 M NH4NO3 using 30% TBP in Isopar-M, while americium was only partially (≤30%) transferred to the organic phase in the Am(III) form. In this case, a high degree of separation of Cm from Am(V) remaining in the aqueous phase was attained (≥99.9%). At the moment, only a few other works [14–16] are known on the use of TBP as an extractant for separating Am from other transuranium elements or lanthanides. For example, in [14, 16], it was proposed to extract Am(VI) directly from nitric acid solutions without adding a salting-out agent. Reaching high distribution coeﬃ cients can be performed by adjusting the solution acidity. At the initial stage, a decrease in acidity is provided for the eﬃ cient oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI), then its increase it to 1 M relative to HNO3. The separation factor for the Am–Nd pair was about 50; therewith separation of the Am–Np pair did not occur. In [15], it was proposed to use dihydrogen phosphate to bind Nd into a more stable complex compared to Am(VI), which allowed to reach a separation factor of about 120. This work is aimed at studying the extraction of Am in higher oxidation states in weakly acidic solutions— simulants of the actinide–lanthanide fraction of a highly active raﬃ nate, containing americium and curium isotopes and weight amounts of lanthanides (with praseodymium as an example)—using TBP and in the presence of ammonium nitrate as a salting-out agent, not forming insoluble salts with actinides and ﬁ ssion products, including lanthanides.

Context: The elemental composition of SNF from VVER- 1000 reactors with a burnup of 60 GW day/(t U) and holding for 8 years was calculated in [17]. It is shown that the fraction of fragmented lanthanides is 17.2 mg per 1 g of initial uranium. Provided that during the dissolution of SNF it is planned to increase the uranium concentration to 600 g/L, the actinide-lanthanide fraction will account for up to 10.5 g/L of fragmented lanthanides. In this work, we used Pr as a lanthanide simulant, whose absorption bands do not coincide with those of Am(III), Am(V), and Am(VI), which makes it possible to determine the concentrations in solution of both Pr and Am in various oxidation states by the spectrophotometric method. To prepare a model solution of the actinide– lanthanide fraction, the 241Am, 243Am, and 244Сm isotopes were used, the concentrations of which in the initial solution were 2.48 × 10–3, 1.28 × 10–1, and 1.38 × 10–4 g/L, respectively. The Pr concentration was 10.5 g/L. Americium was transferred to the highest oxidation states Am(VI) and then to Am(V) according to the following reactions (1) and (2), respectively:

Context: Figure 1 shows the spectrum (1) of an initial 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing trivalent Am, Cm, and Pr with the concentrations given in Table 1 as well as spectrum (2) of the same solution after the quantitative oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) according to the procedure described in the experimental part. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the presence in the solution of an almost 100-fold excess of Pr compared to Am (10.5 and 0.13 g/L, respectively) does not aﬀ ect the Am(III) oxidation. We preliminarily studied the extraction of Am(VI) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the pres- ence of 8 M NH4NO3 with 30% TBP in Isopar-M (Table 1). It can be seen from the data in Table 1 that both trivalent Cm and Pr and Am(VI) are extracted to a high degree (up to 95 wt %) under the conditions of the study. The distribution coeﬃ cients (D) of Am(VI), Cm(III), and Pr(III) per an extraction were about 2.5, 3.6, and 1.8, respectively. DAm(VI) = 2.5 correlates with the data of [21], where the maximum distribution co- eﬃ cient was achieved at 4 M HNO3 and the minimum phase contact time, and, however, it was slightly lower than in [16], where 100% TBP was used for extraction. Spectrophotometric method was applied to prove that agent by heating the solution at 90°C for 20 min according to the procedure described in [11]. The eﬃ ciency of this method is usually limited by nitric acid concentrations of no more than 0.5 M [18]. At higher acid concentrations, ammonium persulfate decomposes to form hydrogen peroxide, an eﬀ ective reducing agent 2+ [19]. However, this eﬀ ect, apparently, can be for AmO2 leveled by increasing the concentration of the oxidizing agent to 1.6 M [14], which enabled oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) in 1 M HNO3 by 90 ± 5%. A solution containing Am(V) was obtained by adding 1 μL of a 37% H2O2 solution to 1 mL of an Am(VI) solution in 0.1 M HNO3 previously prepared as described above. The authors of [20] report the possibility of direct preparation of Am(V) in 0.1 M HNO3 by heating to 80–100°C and an ammonium persulfate concentration of 1 M. The completeness of Am(III) oxidation to Am(VI) and its subsequent reduction to Am(V), their behavior during extraction, as well as the concentration of Pr(III) in the solution were monitored by a spectrophotometric method (Unicam UV-300, Unicam Instruments, UK) according to absorption bands at 503 and 814 nm for Am(III), 513 and 717 nm for Am(V), 666 and 996 nm for Am(VI), and 445 and 592 nm for Pr. In extraction experiments, a 30% TBP solution in Isopar-M was used, which was preliminarily contacted for 5 min with an equal volume of a 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing 0.2 M (NH4)2S2O8. Before extraction, a weighed portion of NH4NO3 was introduced into the resulting solutions containing Am(VI) or Am(V), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, to achieve its concentration in the solution of 8 M, as in [13]. Extraction of actinides and Pr was carried out for 1 min at a ratio of aqueous (A) and organic (O) phases of 1 : 5. As we determined earlier [13], 1 min is enough to set thermodynamic equilibrium at the distribution of Am(III) and Cm between a nitric acid solution containing NH- 4NO3 as a salting-out agent and 30% TBP in isopar-M. The phases were brought into contact with each other by shaking the tubes by hand for 1 min. The phases were then centrifuged to separate them for about 1 min at 2000 rpm. After the phases were separated and analyzed. The total concentration of Am and Cm in the used solutions was found by alpha spectrometry (Alpha Analyst, Canberra, USA).

Context:  Am(VI) in organic phase is reduced mainly to Am(V) and partially to Am(III), and after 1 day storage, Am(V) completely transforms into Am(III). However, in some works, contradictions were noted regarding the stability of Am(VI) in the presence of TBP. Thus, the authors of [14, 16] point to the relative stability of Am in the or- ganic phase, while it was stated in [21] that contact with organic phase led to a rapid americium reduction result- ing in a lower D(Am) than expected. Thus, from the data in Table 1, it can be concluded that Am(VI), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, is successfully extracted with 30% TBP in Isopar-M from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of NH4NO3 salting-out agent. Therefore, this approach to the separation of Am(VI) from Cm and lanthanides un- der these conditions is technologically unrealizable.

Context:  Fig. 2. Absorption spectra of Am(V) and Pr(III) in 0.1 M HNO3 before (1) and after (2) adding salting-out agent (8 M NH4NO3). The main problem of using Am(V) for its separation from Cm and REE is its reduction to Am(III), which is well extractable under these conditions. The Am(V) reduction occurs under the action of radiolysis products [22], disproportionation of Am(V) [23], and due to contact with organic phase. Selection of the conditions under which the extraction of Am(V) in TBP will be minimal without replacing TBP with the TODGA extractant, which is not yet available for industrial technology, as was done in [24, 25], will make it possible to achieve the quantitative separation of americium from curium, as well from lanthanides. Thus, an important task for future research is the stabilization of americium in its weakly extractable form Am(V).

Context: 1. OECD-NEA Potential Beneﬁ ts and Impacts of Advanced Nuclear Fuel Cycles with Actinide Partitioning and Transmutation; Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), Paris: OECD, 2011. The extraction of Am(V) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of 8 M NH4NO3 with 30% TBP in Isopar-M was studied. It was preliminarily conﬁ rmed that the addition of the salting-out agent NH4NO3 to the solution does not lead to a change in the oxidation state of Am(V) (Fig. 2). Experiments were conducted in which the Pr content was 1.05 or 10.5 g/L at a constant content of Am(V) and Cm; extraction was performed at a ratio of A : O = 1 : 5. Data of Table 2 show that diﬀ erent Pr content does not lead to a change in the degree of extraction of Am(V) in a one-stage extraction. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Am(V) is found to be about 0.1; americium is extracted in organic phase by no more than 30% of its content in the initial solution, which is consistent with the data of [13]. At the same time, the distribution coeﬃ cients of Pr and Cm are found to be very close, about 1 (Table 2), and the degree of their extraction is 80–85% per extraction cycle. It was noted that the separation factor SFCm/Am is found to be signiﬁ cantly lower than in [13], when it was possible to extract Cm almost completely in organic phase (SFCm/Am was 65). Obviously, this can be explained by the eﬀ ect of more than a hundredfold amount of Pr present in the solution relative to the initial Am content. It should also be taken into account that the concentrations of Am and Cm in the initial solution were several orders of magnitude higher (0.13 and 1.38 × 10–4, respectively) than in [13]. At the same time, it was shown that the separation fac- tor can be increased by using a three-stage extraction at a volume ratio of A : O = 1 : 1, as it was demonstrated for Pr in the absence of TPE (Table 3). In this case, the degree of its extraction reached 98%, even though the total volume of the extractant was 1.6 times less than in the case of one-stage extraction with the ratio A : O = 1 : 5.

Context: Abstract—The solvent extraction of the 90Y/90Sr pair from carbonate media with mixtures of aromatic dihydroxy compounds and a quaternary ammonium salt—methyltrioctylammonium carbonate (MTOAC)—in toluene and butyl acetate was studied. It was found that MTOAC increases the distribution coeﬃ cients of both the extractant itself and its solvate with yttrium due to the formation of a mixed complex of yttrium and a dihydroxyaromatic ligand with MTOAC. During extraction from alkaline carbonate media in the pH range of 12–13.5 with mixtures of 0.01 M 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 0.015 M MTOAC in butyl acetate or toluene, the distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium exceed 80; the separation factors of the 90Y/90Sr pair under these conditions are more than 105. Dilute solutions of hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric acids can be used for the complete stripping of yttrium. The studied mixtures are chemically stable and do not change the extraction properties upon multiple extraction/stripping cycles. Model experiments on the leaching of yttrium from natural samples showed that the percentage of stable yttrium extraction from sand is 70–80%, while the percentage of yttrium extraction from soil is 50–60%.

Context: The isotope 90Sr, formed during the ﬁ ssion of uranium and plutonium nuclei, together with 137Cs makes the main contribution to the global pollution of water and soil on Earth. Atmospheric nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility of 90Sr brings about its distribution in the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of living beings, where it concentrates in the bones and damages the surrounding tissues. The obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment is complicated by its nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the matrix material, exposure until equilibrium with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid– liquid extraction is widely used for the separation of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is eﬃ ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2]. But in both cases, a preliminary acid digesting of the samples is necessary, which involves the use of toxic and aggressive reagents. We proposed

Mixtures of alkylammonium salts with organic acids, binary extractants, eﬃ ciently extract metals [4]. Phenolic groups are known to dissociate in alkaline media, and a similar eﬀ ect can be expected for mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with alkylammonium salts.

Context:  Model experiments with natural samples were conducted as follows. A sample of building sand was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and dried in an oven. After that, a sample of sand weighing 1 g was taken. A solution of stable yttrium nitrate was added to the sample in such an amount that its concentration in the ﬁ nal sample was 30 mg/L, everything was thoroughly mixed and dried in an oven, after which 3 g of Na2CO3 and K2CO3 were added to the sample. The resulting mixture was calcined in a muﬄ e for 1 h at 500°C. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the sample was placed in a polypropylene test tube, 50 mL of the leaching agent solution was added to the sample (5 leaching agents were tested in total—H2O/H2O2 (3 : 2), NaHCO3/H2O2, NH4HCO3/H2O2, and (NH4)2CO3/H2O2, (NH4)2CO3). For 2 h, a sample of sand was contacted at stirring with the aqueous phase to transfer yttrium carbonate into the aqueous phase. Then the aqueous phase was separated and sent for extraction with a mixture of 0.01 M 2.3DHN + 0.015 M MTOAC in toluene at a volume ratio of the organic and aqueous phases O : A = 1 : 1 and a contact time of 10 min. Afterwards, the phases were separated by centrifugation. Yttrium was stripped from the organic phase with a 0.05 M HNO3 solution at O : A = 5 : 1, after which the nitric acid aqueous solution was separated by centrifugation. The content of stable yttrium was measured therein by the spectrophotometric method. A soil sample (500 g), taken in a forest belt on the territory of the Leningrad Region, was homogenized, sifted through a sieve and mixed with a radioactive label containing a 90Y/90Sr pair being in radioactive equilibrium with a total activity of 530 Bq (the speciﬁ c activity of the soil was about 1 Bq/g ). A soil sample labelled with 90Y/90Sr was dried in an oven, after which a sample (2 g) was taken.

Context: yttrium extraction, was determined by the method of isomolar series (Fig. 2). It can be seen that a 1.5- fold excess of MTOAC with respect to 2,3DHN is optimal, which suggests the formation of a solvate of the composition [Y(2,3DHN)2(MTOAC)3] [6]. The existence of a complex of this composition is conﬁ rmed by the MS-ESI(–) data: in addition to the 2,3DHN monoanion (m/z = 159.0448), there is a signal with m/z = 404.8723 of the [Y(2,3DHN)2]– monoanion. The MS- ESI(–) spectra contain signals from anionic complexes, which, in addition to yttrium and 2,3DHN, include carbonate and hydroxyl groups and water molecules. Compared to pure 2,3DHN and MTOAC, their synergistic mixture extracts yttrium with distribution coeﬃ cients approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher: for 0.005 M MTOAC in PhMe, DY = 0.47, for 0.005 М 2,3DHN DY = 2.5 × 10–5, and for their mixture DY = 32 (Fig. 2). As already noted, the maximum extraction of yttrium by mixtures of dihydroxy compounds with MTOAC is detected at pH above 11. We found that the speciﬁ c form of distribution coeﬃ cient curve for yttrium vs. pH of the aqueous phase is determined by the type of dihydroxy compound and the type of organic solvent (Fig. 3). The most eﬀ ective extractant in both solvents is 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. The lowest distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium, regardless of the type of solvent, are demonstrated by 4-tert-butylpyrocatechol. Its unsubstituted analog, pyrocatechol, extracts yttrium well only into toluene solutions. This may be due to steric factors, since the properties of phenolic groups in these extractants are very similar. High distribution coeﬃ cients of yttrium were found in a water-soluble chelating agent, alizarin, giving a hydrophobic complex with MTOAC, which is concentrated in the organic phase. A solution of alizarin in butyl acetate upon contact with an aqueous phase with a pH below 12.5 forms a third phase. The possibility of eﬃ cient separation of yttrium and strontium was demonstrated by the example of 2,3DHN, the most eﬃ cient of the studied extractants (Fig. 4). The data in Fig. 4 show that at pH > 12, Y/Sr pair separation factors exceed 105 in both toluene and butyl acetate. Such a high selectivity is unattainable in the extraction of strontium with crown ethers [1] or yttrium with alkyl phosphoric acids [2] from nitric acid solutions. Small diﬀ erences in the behavior of stable and radioactive isotopes are most likely associated with a high error in determining the low activities of 90Sr and 90Y in saline solutions. An additional advantage of the studied extraction systems is the simplicity of yttrium stripping with dilute acid solutions. For the quantitative stripping of yttrium, one contact of the extract with 0.05 M solutions

As can be seen from the data in Fig. 6, in all the systems studied, there is a high percentage of yttrium extraction (70–80%), therewith aqueous phases consisting of ammonium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate with the addition of hydrogen peroxide proved to be more eﬀ ective. The introduction of hydrogen peroxide into the leaching solution was proposed for further oxidizing possible organic residues. Table 1 presents data on carbonate penetration and separation of yttrium from a soil sample containing the 90Y/90Sr radioactive label and stable yttrium with strontium. Based on the measurement results, the percentage of 90Y extraction from the soil was calculated (ﬁ nal value after all operations). The data obtained show that leaching from a soil sample is less eﬃ cient than from pure sand, which may be due to the high content of mineral acid salts in the soil, which pass into the aqueous phase during leaching and interfere with the complete extraction of yttrium, as well to the possibility of mechanical retention of yttrium by microdispersed particles.

Context: Abstract—Various methods have been developed for the extraction of a promising medical radionuclide 117mSn from proton-irradiated TiSb intermetallic compound, a target material suitable for irradiation with an intense beam of accelerated protons. To separate radiotin from Ti, Sb, and radionuclides of other elements, methods of ion- exchange chromatography and liquid extraction were used, in particular, the anion-exchange separation of tin and titanium in the form of a peroxide complex in HCl solution, extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions, and chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from citrate solutions. As a result, 117mSn of high purity, which meets the requirements for nuclear medicine, was obtained. Keywords: 117mSn, TiSb intermetallic compound, proton irradiation, separation of radiotin and titanium, ion exchange, extraction. DOI: 10.1134/S1066362221060114 In recent decades, the therapy of oncological and other human diseases with the use of radiopharmaceuticals (RP) has developed signiﬁ cantly. More than 80% of cancer patients suﬀ er from bone metastases [1]. Interstitial radionuclide therapy using RP based on radionuclides releasing electrons is one of the eﬀ ective methods of treating patients with widespread bone metastases. RP based on the 117mSn radionuclide (in particular, 117mSn4+DTPA) [2–5] have a number of advantages over other drugs. The decay of the metastable radionuclide 117mSn is accompanied by the release of monoenergetic conversion electrons (127, 129, and 152 keV) with a short and discrete range of 0.2–0.3 mm in biological tissue. Soft radiation leads to a local eﬀ ect on tumor cells without damaging healthy tissues. The γ-radiation (159 keV) during the decay of 117mSn may be used to control the therapeutic eﬀ ect (theranostics). Clinical trials of drugs 117mSn4+DTPA for the relief of bone pain, 117mSn4+DOTA-annexin for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and the 117mSn colloid for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are being successfully carried out [1, 6]. Until recently, 117mSn was produced mainly from the reactions of stable tin isotopes, 116Sn(n,γ)117mSn or 117Sn(n,n’γ)117mSn, with neutrons. In this case, the speciﬁ c activity of 117mSn did not exceed 740 GBq/g (20 Ci/g) [2, 7]. The presence of stable tin seriously limits the possibilities of medical application of the reactor-produced 117mSn. A product with a high speciﬁ c activity can be obtained via reactions with accelerated charged particles, of which two approaches are the most promising and demonstrate comparable production rates of 117mSn: nat,121,123Sb(p,x)117mSn [8, 9] and 116Cd(α,3n)117mSn [10,11]. Nowadays, powerful and compact cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type, developed and manufactured by the IBA Company (Belgium), are becoming more widespread, capable of accelerating proton beams with an intensity of more than 300 μA to an energy of 70 MeV. Such cyclotrons are successfully applied for large-scale production of radioisotopes, mainly for medical purposes [12, 13]. On the basis of experimentally determined cross sections, it was shown [14] that the 117mSn radionuclide can be produced by proton irradiation of an antimony target with an initial energy of 145 MeV and below. Irradiation of natural antimony or antimony enriched with 123Sb with the proton energy 55 or 70 MeV, respectively, leads to the formation of 117mSn, which contains a trace amount of the undesirable long-lived radioisotope 113Sn. The presence of another long-lived radioisotope 119mSn (Т1/2 = 293 days), as impurity, which releases soft

Context: gamma radiation during decay into stable 119Sn, does not interfere with medical use of 117mSn. Therefore, the implementation of the nat,123Sb(p,x)117mSn approach on cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type for producing large amounts of 117mSn of medical quality seems especially promising. In [15], we proposed a method for obtaining no-carrier-added 117mSn from a thick target of metallic antimony irradiated with protons. After dissolution of the antimony target, the radiotin was isolated by liquid- liquid extraction (LLE) with dibutyl ether, followed by exhaustive puriﬁ cation on silica gel. The method provides production of up to 3 Ci (100 GBq) 117mSn of high radionuclidic purity with a speciﬁ c activity of about 1000 Ci/g (more than 40 GBq/mg). However, since metallic antimony has low thermal conductivity, low melting point and high vapor pressure, antimony targets cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high-intensity proton currents. In addition, antimony actively interacts with many materials that are usually used for the manufacture of the target shell, which leads to its radiation damage. Instead of metallic antimony, intermetallic compounds, such as TiSb, NiSb, and AlSb, were considered as a target material, of which TiSb turned out to be the most promising [16]. The TiSb properties, unique in many respects, have been studied since the 1950s [17]. The compound combines high stability (the enthalpy of formation is estimated as –167 kJ/mol [18]), and a high melting point of 1160°C with pronounced metallic properties, including high electrical and thermal conductivity. According to our estimate, the value of the latter is twice the thermal conductivity of titanium and antimony taken separately. In the chemical separation of 117mSn from irradiated TiSb, it is necessary to remove not only macro-quantites of antimony, but also macroquantites of titanium. Previously, removal of antimony was studied in [15]. Removal of titanium is diﬃ cult due to the similarity of its chemical behavior with that of tin; in the few studies described in the literature, extraction and chromatographic separation methods are used. Sn(IV) can be extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone from 7 M HCl solutions, while Ti(IV) remains in the aqueous phase [19]. Then, the tin is reextracted with dilute solutions of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid [20]. In analytical practice, tin is also extracted with benzene from HI solutions. The extraction of tin with

Context: benzene proceeds most eﬃ ciently at a perchloric acid content of 4.66 M, sulfuric acid content of 1 M (total acidity 6.6 M), and a potassium iodide content of 0.5 M. In this case, titanium and antimony, as well as I–III metals, including indium and scandium, are not extracted [21]. Tin is reextracted with a 1–2 M HCl solution. However, this technique was developed only for the analytical determination of milligram amounts of tin [22]; its applicability for isolation of no-carrier- added radiotin has not been studied. Chromatographic separation of Ti(IV) from ions of other metals is possible by sorption of titanium in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on a weakly basic anion exchanger Amberlite CG-4B [23]. A similar behavior of Ti(IV) is observed on AG 50W-X8 and Dowex 50W cation exchangers in 0.05 M H2SO4 solutions with the addition of 1% H2O2 [24]. Ti(IV) is not adsorbed on strongly basic anion-exchange resins (Dowex 1×8 and AG 1 × 8) [25]. As known, Ti forms peroxide complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+, positively charged and stable in strongly acidic solutions. At the same time, Sn forms the anionic complex [SnCl6]2– in strong hydrochloric acid solutions; therefore, the separation of oppositely charged Sn and Ti complexes can be carried out both on cation-exchange and anion-exchange resins. For example, when a hydrochloric acid solution of Sn and Ti containing a minor excess of H2O2, is passed through an anion-exchange resin, [SnCl6]2– anions are adsorbed, whereas [TiO(H2O2)] cations pass through the column. Then, tin is desorbed by passing through the column solutions that decompose the [SnCl6]2– anionic complex. For separating trace amounts of tin from macroquantites of titanium, this method is preferable, since it does not require large volumes of sorbent. Basically, the methods presented in the literature have been developed for the separation of macroquantities of Sn, Sb, and Ti, while the behavior of radionuclides in the “no-carrier-added” state can diﬀ er signiﬁ cantly. When producing 117mSn of high speciﬁ c activity, it is necessary to separate the macroquantites of Sb and Ti from the ul- tramicroquantities of Sn. In addition, proton irradiation of antimony and titanium produces other radionuclides, capable of aﬀ ecting purity of the target product, and they must also be separated from tin. In this study, we propose options for the extraction of 117mSn with a high speciﬁ c activity from the proton-irradiated antimony– titanium intermetallic compound to prepare RP.

Context: Preparation and irradiation of experimental targets. The radionuclides 124Sb (carrier-added), 113Sn, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn (no-carrier-added) used in this study for model experiments were obtained from irradiated antimony targets by the method described in [9]. 44Ti was supplied by CJSC Cyclotron (Obninsk). Antimony–titanium intermetallic compound was formed by argon-arc melting of antimony and titanium powder in a molar ratio of 1: 1 [16]. To prepare the target, the crushed intermetallide was placed in an electron-beam welded titanium container 5 mm thick and was heated at a temperature of 910°C and a pressure of 150 MPa in argon for 1.5 h [26]. To produce radionuclides and study their chemical behavior, targets from the TiSb intermetallic compound and also from metallic antimony were irradiated. The activity of the used radionuclides was in the range of several μCi (~ 100 kBq). Irradiation was carried out at a high-precision accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research (Troitsk, Moscow) with the initial proton beam energy varied from 110 to 140 MeV and at the current 1–50 μA [27]. Materials and reagents. For preparing aqueous solutions, we used concentrated acids (HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4) and deionized water from a Millipore Simplicity water puriﬁ cation unit. Antimony was extracted with dibutyl ether. For chromatographic separation of titanium, we used: (1) strongly basic monofunctional anionites AG 1×8 (Bio Rad, USA) and Dowex 1×8 (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –N+(CН3)3 as the mai functional group; (2) Dowex 50×8 cation exchanger (Dow, USA) based on a styrene copolymer with divinylbenzene containing –SO3H as the main functional group. Particle size is 100 mesh, crosslinking, 8%, and bulk density of resins, 0.8 g/mL. Macroquantites of titanium were removed by extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone, benzene, and KI (all chemically pure grade). The ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of the radiotin was carried out by chromatography on silica gel with a particle size of 100–160 μm. The reagents were of special purity or chemically pure grade. Experimental technique. In model solutions used to develop the technique for separating radiotin from the titanium – antimony intermetallide, the maximum concentrations of the macrocomponents were 75 and 30 g/L for antimony and titanium, respectively. The above concentrations were chosen by assuming that the mass of the target for the production of large amounts of 117mSn is about 40 g, of which 29 g are antimony and 11 g, titanium. Most of the antimony in the presence of titanium was separated by extraction with dibutyl ether from a 10 M HCl solution [15].

Context:  For the chromatographic puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, we prepared 10 mL of model solutions containing Ti, Sb, H2O2, 6 M HCl, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn). The content of Ti varied from 1.5 to 30 g/L, the Sb content varied from (2–5)×10–3 g/L, a value corresponding to the addition of the 124Sb label, to 14.4 g/L, the H2O2 : Ti molar ratio was from 1 : 1 to 1.5 : 1. The label was obtained from an irradiated antimony target. The sorption and desorption of tin was performed under dynamic conditions by passing the solution through a column (d = 0.6 cm) with a sorbent layer 6 cm high. Two anion-exchange resins were used as sorbents: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Before ﬁ lling the column, the sorbents were kept in 6 M HCl for 12 h. First, 10 mL of the initial solution was passed through the ﬁ lled column at a rate of 0.8 mL/min and then 40–50 mL of a 6 M HCl washing solution passed. For desorption of radiotin, 1–4 M HNO3 solutions were used. Model solutions used for extraction have a total acidity of 6.6 M and a volume of 30 mL and contain 4.66 М HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, Ti (20 g/L), Sb in the form of antimony chloride with a concentration from (2– 5)×10–3 to 1 g/L, and 0.2–1 М KI. Also, (113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, 123mTe, and 114mIn) produced from the irradiated antimony target was added to the model solution as label. To prepare a model solution, a weighed portion of KI was preliminarily dissolved in a minor amount of water and added, with vigorous stirring, to a mixture of HClO4 and H2SO4 acids. Iodine was formed, and the larger the weight of KI sample, the darker the solution. However, even at low KI concentrations, when the solution was light yellow, a precipitate formed, presumably HIO. The solution was left for a day to reach equilibrium. Then, it was ﬁ ltered, and the label and stable titanium and antimony were added, and after that, the extraction was performed. The prepared solution was stored for no more than a week. As the organic phase, we used benzene previously saturated with a solution of 4.66 М HClO4 +

At each stage, the stirring time of the phases was 30–40 s, and separation time, 10 min. The radiotin was reextracted in 60 mL of 1.5 M HCl (stirring time 5–6 min, and separation time, 17–20 min). At the ﬁ nal stage, exhaustive puriﬁ cation and concentration of radiotin on silica gel from a model solution of 2 M HNO3 labeled with 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was performed, according to the procedure described in detail in [15]. To study the interaction of the TiSb intermetallic compound with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were dissolved by heating in concentrated HCl, to which H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 were added, as oxidizing agent. The completeness of dissolution was controlled by weighing the undissolved residue. The content of titanium and antimony in the residue and the concentration of antimony in the solution were calculated from results of the spectrophotometric determination of the titanium concentration in the solution. For testing the developed technique, we manufac- tured, irradiated, and processed an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound.

Macroquantities of titanium were determined spec- trophotometrically with hydrogen peroxide (absorption maximum 416 nm, e416 = 810 L/mol cm) and dianti- pyrylmethane (DAM). Ti (IV) forms a strong complex compound with DAM in 0.5–4 M HCl with an absorp- tion maximum at 389 nm. The absorption coeﬃ cient e389 = 3.3 104 L/mol cm is much higher than that of H2O2.

Context: Isolation of no-carrier-added 117mSn from an irradiated antimony target is not an easy task, since these elements have similar chemical behavior. In the case of the separation of 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound, the task is complicated by the need to purify also from titanium, which also exhibits chemical properties close to that of tin. Therefore, the main task of this study was the eﬃ cient separation, providing a high chemical yield, of radiotin from the macrocomponents of antimony and titanium. For puriﬁ cation from the main amount of antimony in the presence of titanium, we used extraction with dibutyl ether, which was described previously in the absence of titanium in [15]. Extraction was performed from a model 10 M HCl solution containing 55 g/L Sb, 20 g/L Ti, and a label (113Sn, 124Sb, and 44Ti) (Table 2). The study showed that following three successive extractions, more than 99.7% of antimony passes into dibutyl ether, while radiotin and titanium remain in the aqueous phase. After the ﬁ rst stage of extraction, the concentration of antimony decreases to 1.5 g/L. After three stages, it may be reduced to 0.1 g/ L. More than 95% of titanium and radiotin remain in the aqueous phase. It was found that the extraction of antimony in the presence of titanium proceeds in the same way as in its absence. For the subsequent puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium macroquantities, both chromatography on strong anion exchangers with the addition of hydrogen peroxide and extraction with benzene from iodide solutions were used.

Context: of positively charged complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+. These complexes are stable in acidic media, including HCl, in which tin forms the anionic complexes [SnCl6]2–. Our preliminary experiments showed that Ti macroquantities are not sorbed from 2 M HCl and are not completely sorbed from 1 M HCl. The ion-exchange separation of radiotin from titanium was carried out from 0.5 M HCl, while the titanium concentration was reduced by a factor of 20. However, this method is not entirely suitable for solving our problem, since large volumes of sorbent are required to remove macroamounts of titanium, which should be disposed and lead to the loss of radiotin. The separation of radiotin from titanium on strongly basic anion exchangers turned out to be more promising approach. The above possibility was studied on model solutions. The chromatographic procedure consisted of passing a hydrochloric acid solution of radiotin and titanium, containing a small stoichiometric excess of H2O2, through an anion exchange resin. In this case, [SnCl6]2– anions were sorbed on the column, while [TiO(H2O2)]2+ cations passed through the column. The column was washed with 6 M HCl to remove titanium. The titanium concentration in the washing solution and, as a consequence, in the target product depended on the degree of puriﬁ cation of the initial solution from macroamounts of antimony (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that an increase in the antimony concentration has adverse eﬀ ect on the puriﬁ cation from titanium.

At the same time, they diﬀ er in relation to titanium (Fig. 2). Figure 2 shows that titanium is more easily washed out of a

Therefore, further experiments were performed with AG 1 × 8 resin. After washing, part of tellurium remains on the column, in addition to radiotin. Radiotin was eluted with a nitric acid solution, which decomposes the anionic complex. Table 3 shows the dependence of the amount of radiotin remaining in the adsorbed state on the nitric acid concentration. With an increase in the HNO3 concentration, the yield of radiotin increases, while tellurium radionuclides start to desorb simultaneously. Optimal for elution is 2 M HNO3. In this case, a radiotin yield of about 90% is achieved, and the content of tellurium radionuclides is reduced by about 2-fold. Heating nitric acid to 40°C increases the radiotin yield up to 98%. A high content of antimony in the initial solution not only has adverse eﬀ ect on the removal of titanium, but also decreases the yield of radiotin, which can be seen from the integral curves of 113Sn elution at various concentrations of antimony in the initial solutions (Fig. 3). Increasing the antimony concentration in the solution to 3.6 g/L reduces the radiotin yield to 90%. Thus, the presence of antimony with a concentration on the order of 1 g/L will be quite acceptable for eﬃ cient separation of 117mSn and titanium at this stage. Change in the chromatographic behavior can be followed in Fig.4, demonstrating curves of elution of antimony from the column upon washing with a 6 M HCl and desorption of radiotin in a 2 M HNO3 on the antimony concentration in the initial solution. As seen, with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, it is less retained by the sorbent upon passage of 6 M HCl and is desorbed with 2 M HNO3 by a broader peak. Based on the above dependences, the following optimal parameters of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and titanium were determined:

Thus, this method does not allow for complete puriﬁ cation of the radiotin from titanium macroquantities in a high yield.

Context:  – selective elution of titanium with respect to radiotin should be carried out in a 6 M HCl (for a chromatographic column volume of 2.5–3 mL and a sorbent layer height of 6–7 cm, 50 mL of 6 M HCl is suﬃ cient). For desorption of radiotin, a 2 M HNO3 solution heated to 40°C should be used; with the above column parameters, 25 mL of 2 M HNO3 is suﬃ cient to extract 98–99% of the radiotin. The puriﬁ cation factor from Ti depends on its concentration in the initial solution and reaches 104 at a titanium concentration of 25 g/L; a puriﬁ cation factor of up to 106 may be achieved after two stages of chromatographic puriﬁ cation. Extraction separation of radiotin from titanium. Along with the chromatographic method, extraction methods are also used to separate radiotin from titanium macroquantities. One of these methods is extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone [19]. Our model experiments showed that methyl isobutyl ketone extracts up to 80% of radiotin from 7 M HCl, while the titanium concentration decreases 200 times. The extraction of radiotin from a solution of 7 M Another extraction method of separation from titanium, providing up to 99-% yield, is the extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions. This method was studied for the separation of milligram amounts of tin from titanium and antimony in [21]. The behavior of a no-carrier-added tin may diﬀ er from the behavior of macroscopic amounts of tin. The diﬀ erence in the extraction behavior of tin is mainly inﬂ uenced by the concentration of stable antimony and iodide ions. It was shown in [15] that after the removal of antimony by extraction with dibutyl ether, a minor amount of it nevertheless remains in the solution. At the ﬁ rst stage, the eﬀ ect of the concentration of antimony in the initial solution on the extraction of radiotin with benzene was studied. In this case, the KI concentration was kept constant (0.5 M). In the studied range of antimony concentrations (2–5) × 10–3–1 g/L, at least 98% of radiotin is extracted with two 10-mL portions of benzene. The dependence of the extraction of antimony on its concentration in the initial solution is demonstrated in Fig. 5. As seen, the more antimony in the initial solution, the more it is extracted into the organic phase (salting out eﬀ ect). Therefore, the antimony concentration should be minimal.

Context: Fig. 5. Dependences of the fraction of extracted antimony (1) and the concentration of titanium in the reextract (2) on the concentration of antimony in the initial solution. Fig. 6. Loss on the sediment formed in the organic phase after extraction and on the surface of chemical glassware. Curve: (1) antimony (124Sb) and (2) 113Sn. For reextraction of radiotin from the organic phase, we used 1.5 M HCl and 0.25 M H2SO4 solutions proposed in the literature [22]. The eﬃ ciencies of reextraction with solutions of both acids were found to be close. Since further puriﬁ cation was performed in hydrochloric acid solutions, 1.5 M HCl was used for reextraction. The inﬂ uence of the initial concentration of antimony on the reextraction was investigated. In particular, it was shown that with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, the puriﬁ cation degree of radiotin, reextracted from benzene, from titanium also decreases (Fig. 5). It was found that after a certain time (within an hour) elapsed after extraction, a white precipitate formed in the organic phase. For tin rextraction, the organic phase was decanted, with some radiotin remaining on the sediment and on the surface of the chemical glassware (Fig. 6). The inﬂ uence of the concentration of antimony and iodide ions in the initial solution on the loss of radionu- clides in the sediment was studied. As seen, the loss of ra- diotin in the sediment increases with increasing antimony concentration (Fig. 6). To minimize the loss, it is neces- sary to limit the interval between extraction and reextrac- tion, and also to reduce the concentration of antimony in the initial solution to 0.1 g/L. But even at this minimum concentration the amount of precipitate increases with an increase in the KI concentration. The loss of radiotin in the KI concentration range studied, 0.2–1 M, was within 10–15%, and the content of antimony in the precipitate increased with KI concentration. Since titanium is not

Context: extracted in signiﬁ cant quantities, antimony remains the only macrocomponent that can lead to insoluble com- pounds. Based on the fact that the content of antimony in the precipitate increases with concentrations of both antimony and KI, it can be assumed that the precipitate is Sb(V) iodide or its derivatives. The eﬀ ect of the concentration of iodide ions on the course of extraction was studied at the constant concentration of antimony in the initial solution equal to 0.1 g/L. It was found that, in the concentration range studied, 0.2–1 M, the KI concentration dramatically aﬀ ects the extraction of radiotin and antimony: at low concentra- tions, antimony is extracted, while up to 70% of radiotin remains in the aqueous phase. With an increase in the KI concentration, the behavior of the elements changes: the radiotin quantitatively leaves the aqueous phase, while the antimony remains (Fig. 7). Analysis of the obtained experimental data showed that more than 98% of titani- um and tellurium radionuclides remained in the aqueous phase after extraction with benzene. In addition, iodide ions contribute to a more complete separation of radio- tin from titanium. With KI concentration increased from 0.2 to 1 mol/L, the degree of puriﬁ cation from titanium is increased by a factor of 4–5. Based on the above dependences, the optimal parameters of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium were selected: – the concentration of antimony in the initial solu- tion should be below 0.1 g/L, i.e. it must ﬁ rst be re- moved, for example, by extraction with dibutyl ether;

Context:  Thus, titanium can be almost completely removed from radiotin by extraction with benzene, whereas trace amounts of antimony and tellurium present in the product may be removed by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel. On processing an irradiated antimony target, such a ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation was performed in a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5), which, in turn, was prepared from a 10 M HCl solution, which is determined by the previous stage of processing described in [15]. In the case of the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, a sodium citrate solution was prepared from a 1.5 M HCl solution, and in the case of chromatographic separation on AG 1 × 8 resin, the preceding solution was 2 M HNO3, not HCl. We checked how traces of nitrate ions aﬀ ect the chromatography eﬃ ciency on silica gel, the formation of antimony complexes with citrate ions in particular. To do this, a citrate solution containing 113Sn, 124Sb, 121mTe, and 44Ti was prepared starting from a 2 M HNO3. The solution was passed through a column ﬁ lled with SiO2, then the column was washed, and radiotin was eluted with 6 M HCl according to the method described in [15]. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 8. It follows from Fig. 5 that the radionuclides Sn, Sb, and Te behave in the same way, as in the absence of nitrate aions. In this case, about 45% of 44Ti remains on the column. Isolation of radiotin from an irradiated TiSb sample. After the process of radiotin separation was studied in model experiments, an experimental target of titanium – antimony intermetallic compound was fabricated and irradiated. The chemical and physical properties of TiSb have been little studied. To study the interaction of TiSb with acids, nonirradiated samples weighing from 0.5 to 20 g were successively dissolved in concentrated HCl and then in concentrated HCl with the addition of HNO3. Heating TiSb in concentrated hydrochloric acid caused solution to turn violet (owing to the formation of Ti3+ ions). As the sample dissolved, the reaction rate decreased. The addition of H2O2 or concentrated HNO3 leads to the resumption of dissolution. However, in this case, Ti3+ transforms into Ti4+, causing precipitation and passivation of the TiSb surface. We succeeded in performing complete dissolution as follows. The bead of the compound was placed in a ﬂ ask, and a concentrated HCl was added. The ﬂ ask was heated for 12 h at reﬂ ux temperature. Solution (no. 1) turned deep violet, indicating the formation of Ti3+ ions. Then, the insoluble residue was transferred into a ﬂ ask with a fresh portion of concentrated HCl, and

Context: Fig. 9. Chromatographic isolation of titanium during the separation of radiotin from an irradiated TiSb target. Sorbent AG 1×8. Column 0.8 cm in diameter and 8 cm in height, ﬂ ow rate 0.8 mL/min. a concentrated HNO3 was added dropwise on heating. Violent dissolution and formation of a white suspension was observed. After 4 h, dissolution was complete. After cooling the thus obtained solution (no. 2), the precipitate was ﬁ ltered oﬀ. To the solution (no. 1) a ﬁ ltered solution (no. 2) was added. This method was used to dissolve an experimental TiSb sample irradiated in an accelerator. It was shown that radiotin is not adsorbed on the formed sediment at the acidity above 3 M HCl. The composite solution was transferred into a 10 M HCl solution, and macroquantites of antimony were removed by extraction with dibutyl ether. Since model experiments demonstrated the possibility of puriﬁ cation from titanium macroquantities both by extraction and by chromatography, the solution obtained after removing antimony was divided into two portions to test both methods. The ﬁ rst portion was puriﬁ ed from titanium on a chromatographic column, and the second portion, by extraction with benzene from iodide solutions. For chromatographic puriﬁ cation on an AG 1 × 8 column, the solution was diluted to 6 M HCl. Results of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and Ti are demonstrated in Fig. 9. Passing the initial solution and subsequent washing the column with a 6 M HCl caused titanium to wash out of the column in the form of a positively charged complex [TiO(H2O2)]2+ and as trivalent cations of indium and scandium radioisotopes, while radiotin and antimony in the form of anionic complexes [SbCl6]– and [SnCl6]2– retained by the sorbent together with tellurium radioisotopes.

Context: Ti, 114mln, 46Sc tellurium occurs. For the ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of the radiotin, chromatographic separation on silica gel was carried out as described above. As a result, the total yield of 117mSn was 75–82%, the puriﬁ cation factors for Sb and Ti were about 106, and the radionuclidic purity of 117mSn was no less than 99.9% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated).

Then, radiotin was reextracted from benzene with 1.5 M HCl. Like chromatography, this method provided puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, indium, and scandium radionuclides. Trace amounts of antimony and tellurium impurities (Table 4) remained after the extraction were removed by further adsorption on silica gel from citrate solutions.

Context: To conclude, the processes of separation of no-carrier- added 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound irradiated with protons have been investigated.

It was shown that the presence of titanium in the resulting solutions does not impede the eﬀ ective extraction of most of the antimony with dibutyl ether.

Context:  Dowex 1 × 8 anion exchangers from a 6 M HCl solution in the presence of H2O2. It was shown that AG-1 × 8 provides higher puriﬁ cation eﬃ ciency. In the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, the best results were achieved for the extraction of radiotin with benzene from a solution containing a mixture of perchloric and sulfuric acids and iodide ions with a concentration of 0.5–1 M. Each of the methods used has its own advantages and disadvantages [30]. In our case, the advantage of extraction in comparison with chromatography is the short time of the process, and the disadvantage is a slightly lower yield of radiotin and worsening of its puriﬁ cation from titanium at a residual concentration of antimony in the initial solution above 0.1 g/L. In our opinion, the method of titanium separation on the AG 1 × 8 anion exchanger is most preferable, since it, although being more time-consuming, is less sensi- tive to the antimony content in the initial solution (about 1 g/L), and is also easier-to-implement in hot chambers. In both methods, the separation of radiotin was terminated by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate at pH 5.5. As a result, the 117mSn product with high radionuclidic purity and high speciﬁ c activity was obtained in at least 75-% yield, which is promising for the development of production technology of 117mSn in large quantities in the future.

Context:  Abstract(cid:0)Diffusion-thermal procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I for radionuclide therapy and positron emission tomography are suggested. For these procedures, new cyclotron targets of metallic tantalum were developed, which, when exposed to high irradiation doses, ensure the absence of physicochemical interaction (diffusion, alloying) of materials being activated and final products with the support at high temperatures. The thermal, hydrodynamic, and strength characteristics of zinc and tellurium (elemental Te) cyclotron targets were evaluated. For commercial target assembly of the COSTIS system, the operation parameters of the proc- ess for preparing 124I from elemental tellurium using the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerators were determined. Recent efforts of leading scientific laboratories and medical centers (Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Paul Scherrer Institute, PSI; Hammersmith Hospital, etc.) were focused on the development of procedures for preparing 67Cu and 124I [1(cid:0)3]. This is due to the unique nuclear-physical properties of 67Cu and 124I, possibility of their production on compact cyclotrons, accelerators of high-energy charged particles, electron accelerators, and moderate-power reactors, and also to rich and well-studied chemistry of these elements. 67Cu is a short-lived radionuclide (T1/2 = 2.58 days) undergoing (cid:2)-decay (100%) [4]. A short path of elec- trons with the energy from 181.5 to 575.0 keV in a living body allows elimination of tumors with a diam- eter of up to 5 mm [5]. The inherent (cid:3)-ray radiation of this radionuclide, whose energy spectrum and quan- tum yield (see below) are similar to those of 67Ga widely used in single-photon emission tomography, is efficiently registered with a commercial scintillation (cid:3)-ray chamber providing reliable monitoring of the behavior of the labeled preparation in patient’s body.

Replacement of the key diagnostic radionuclide iodine-123 by 124I in known RPs such as solution of sodium iodide, solution of sodium o-iodohippurate, m-iodobenzylguanidine, and Iodofen would substantially improve these prepara- tions.

Reactor irradiation. Preparation of 67Cu by the (n, p) reaction is not very promising because to low capture cross sections of thermal neutrons (0.64 (cid:0) 0.82 mb) [8(cid:0)10] and high content of the impurity 64Cu: in the case of (cid:6)natural(cid:7) zinc, the 67Cu : 64Cu ratio is 1 : 700 and at irradiation of enriched 67Zn (93.7% enrichment) the activity of 67Cu reaches only 25(cid:0)28% of the total activity of the target [11]. Irradiation with electron accelerators. Prepara- tion of 67Cu using the bremsstrahlung beams from electron accelerators seems the most promising. In one of the pioneering studies [12], 67Cu was prepared on a 25-MeV electron accelerator (beam current 8(cid:0) 10 (cid:5)A). In irradiation, the target [a stack of 2-mm discs 12 mm in diameter] was placed at a distance of 2 cm from the converter; the irradiation time was varied from 2 to 10 h. It was found that the activity of 67Cu decreases exponentially in the bremsstrahlung beam direction

As seen from the (cid:3)-ray spectrometric data, along the targets contain 64Cu, with the desired product which is probably formed by the 66Zn((cid:3), np) reaction (Ethr 19 MeV). At a beam current of 10 (cid:5)A and irradiation time of 10 h, the yield of 67Cu from the 25-g target [a stack of (cid:6)natural(cid:7) zinc discs (12 mm in diameter), total thickness 30 mm] was 9.25 MBq. In the case of enriched 68Zn, the yield of 67Cu can be increased to 0.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1; simultaneously, the procedure of radiochemical treatment of the zinc targets becomes simpler.

Context: Irrespective of the procedure of radionuclide ac- cumulation, 67Cu can be isolated by vacuum distilla- tion separation of the irradiated zinc targets performed at temperature and pressure providing their complete removal and excluding evaporation of the desired product. This procedure is based on the difference of the evaporation rates and partial vapor pressures of the elements being separated over the solid phase [13]. This method requires changes in the common design of the cyclotron targets (copper or silver sup- ports with deposited isotope material; their modifica- tion should exclude physicochemical interaction (dif- fusion, alloying) of the material being activated and final radionuclides with the support material at elevated temperatures. One of possible solutions is preparation of the targets from inert high-melting materials. Special cyclotron supports were developed for ir- radiation of zinc targets in derived beams of domestic reactors (e.g., U-120 reactor of the St. Petersburg University). In this target, the material to be activated is deposited on a thin (750 (cid:5)m) tantalum support (24 mm in diameter); the (cid:6)loss(cid:7) in the thermal con- ductivity of tantalum as compared to silver and zinc is compensated by optimal combination of the strength and mechanical properties. Zinc metal is deposited by fusion in an inert atmosphere in a special cavity (14 mm in diameter) in the support center. In the course of irradiation, the excess heat is removed from

In the course of irradiation of the en- riched 124Te target with protons with the initial energy of 15(cid:0)18 MeV (e.g., close to the energies of the derived beams of IBA Cyclone 18/9 or MGTs-20 accelerator), the following reactions can proceed: 124Te(p, n)124I, Ethr 3.98 MeV, T1/2 4.18 days; 124Te(p, 2n)123I, Ethr 11.63 MeV, T1/2 13.19 h; 124Te(p, d)123mTe, Ethr 7.24 MeV, T1/2 119.7 days; 124Te(p, 3He)122Sb, Ethr 9.90 MeV, T1/2 2.7 days; 124Te(p, (cid:4)n)120mSb, Ethr 5.33 MeV, T1/2 5.76 days.

Context:  The optimal energy of protons and the yields of the final product and impurity 123I were evaluated using the reference data [7]. However, the data on the in- dustrial production of 124I at the Hammersmith Hos- pital (London, the United Kingdom) [3] showed that the absolute yields of 124I given in this handbook are underestimated by a factor of almost 3.5. For example, the yield of 124I at irradiation of the enriched tellurium target with 12.5-MeV protons is 2.5 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, and not 0.76 MBq (cid:5)A(cid:2)1 h(cid:2)1, as given above. At the same time, the ratios of 124I and 123I are similar: only 2% of 123I is remains in the target after irradiation of the enriched tellurium (99.8%) target.

Context: (Rules and Regulations in Nuclear Power Engineer- ing, hereinafter PNAE) [16]. Criteria for selection of the support material. Comparative analysis of thermal and mechanical prop- erties of these metals (V, Nb, Ta) [6] and typical products of nuclear reactions showed that metallic tan- talum is the best support material for elemental tel- lurium. As compared to commonly used materials (Ag, Cu, Al, Pt), the loss in the thermal conductivity can be compensated by a decrease in the target thick- ness owing to higher strength properties of tantalum. The main aim of this part of the study was to deter- mine the process parameters of preparing 124I under the conditions of operation of the industrial target as- sembly of the COSTIS system (COmpact Solid Target Irradiation System) for the derived beam of the IBA Cyclone 18/9 accelerator. Main parameters of thermal processes in the course of irradiation of tellurium target on tan- talum support are given in Table 2. All further calculations were carried out taking into the data on the operation conditions and account geometric size of the target assembly of the COSTIS system (Fig. 3). In our calculations we used the following data: size of the support disc (24 mm in diameter, 2 mm thick), diameter of the effective irradiation area (12 mm), size of the inlet titanium foil (12 mm in diameter, 0.05 mm thick); temperature of the target assembly (15(cid:0)30(cid:8)C), helium flow rate (25 l min(cid:2)1), water flow rate (16 l min(cid:2)1), and water pressure (0.5 MPa). Since the tellurium target is cooled from the op- posite sides with water and helium, maximal tempera- tures are observed in the material bulk and not on the target surface. The coefficient of heat transfer at the tellurium(cid:0)helium boundary can be calculated only when the helium pressure is known (or set); it can be calculated taking into account the size of titanium window and the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 Calculations of the main characteristics of the helium heat exchanger. Helium heat exchanger is a diffuser(cid:0)confuser. Arrangement of the tellurium and titanium surfaces in the area of this unit strongly intensifies the heat exchange; the diffuser divergence (or confuser convergence) angles in the direction of titanium increase the coefficient of heat transfer at the helium(cid:0)titanium boundary, providing more efficient cooling. At a proton beam current of 15 (cid:5)A, the foil re- ceives 11.2 W and can be cooled by helium convec- tion (at a helium pressure PHe 30 mm Hg) if its mech- anical contact with the stainless-steel frame of the heat exchanger is efficient. With a decrease in the working pressure from 30 to 20 mm Hg, the temperature of the titanium foil de- creases from 136 to 112 (cid:8)C, and the conditional coef- ficient of the pressure reserve increases by a factor of almost 2. However, operation under such conditions is impossible because of the extremely high helium flow velocity (1306 m s(cid:2)1 at PHe < 25 mm Hg) exceeding the speed of sound ((cid:9)1060 m s(cid:2)1). Our calculations of the helium pressures in accor- dance with the requirements of PNAE G-7-002(cid:0)86 [16] showed that the titanium foil can operate at a helium pressure of 30 mm Hg. The maximal working stresses are smaller than 100 MPa at a maximal tem- perature of the titanium window of 138(cid:8)C. With an in- crease in the helium pressure, the mechanical stresses linearly increase; the breaking stress decreases because of increasing temperature of the foil. Evaluation of the principal dimensions of the tantalum support and its strength; determination of the working temperatures of the support and tellurium target. The choice of the dimensions of the tantalum support reduces to evaluation of the thick- ness (STe) of the hollow bottom where tellurium is placed. In turn, STe determines some main character- istics of the target: voltage level, maximal flexure,

However, Our calculations of the stresses and deflections of the tantalum target as influenced by the pressure of cooling water and heat load (i.e., current of the charged particle beam) of the cyclotron target showed that the whole target cross section operates under the conditions of small compression stresses (from (cid:0)14 to (cid:0) 45 MPa), which is the best regime providing stable operation of the metal for more than 100 h at beam currents of up to 20 (cid:5)A.

Context:  Using the procedure for longitudinal flow along an impermeable plate [17, 18], we determined the coeffi- cients of heat transfer of tantalum in water of 98 000 (cid:0) 67 200 W m(cid:2)2 K(cid:2)1, decreasing in the direction from the center. Taking into account these coefficients, we found that the maximal temperature in the irradiated layer of elemental tellurium is lower than 545.6 K (272.6(cid:8)C). Thus, our calculations showed the principal suit- ability of the target of elemental tellurium deposited on a tantalum support; the most dangerous cross sec- tion of the support operates under the compression conditions, which allows the beam current to be in- creased to 20 (cid:5)A. To decrease the deflection of the tantalum support (i.e., to eliminate the possibility of exfoliation of elemental tellurium), its thickness can be increased to 1(cid:0)1.5 mm.

Context: Abstract—Deep puriﬁ cation of the stripped 90Y obtained after the 90Sr/90Y pair extraction separation with D2EHPA from chemical impurities (Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Fe, Zr) employing the TODGA-containing sorbent AXIONIT MND 40T was considered. Also, a two-stage sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair without using the extraction method was developed. At the ﬁ rst stage the 90Y was separated from 90Sr with Purolite D5041 phosphate cation exchange resin, and at the second stage, 90Y deep puriﬁ cation was carried out on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent. The prepared 90Y in radiochemical purity meets the requirements for radiopharmaceuticals. Keywords: sorption, separation, strontium, yttrium, radiopharmaceutical DOI: 10.1134/S1066362221060102

Context: Radionuclide 90Y is one of the ﬁ rst radioactive isotopes to be used for radiotherapy and the interest in 90Y continues although more than 30 radionuclides are currently used for this purpose. This interest is due to its convenient nuclear-physical properties: a half-life of 64.2 h and a maximum β-energy of 2.27 MeV. 90Y is used for a variety of therapeutic purposes including radioimmunotherapy with labeled antibodies, treatment of liver tumors and rheumatoid arthritis [1]. 90Y is formed during the decay of the long-lived radioisotope 90Sr, which is a ﬁ ssion product of uranium. One of the important requirements for the safe clinical use of 90Y is deep puriﬁ cation from 90Sr, which has a high aﬃ nity for bone tissue and can cause bone marrow damage. The regulated 90Sr content in the 90Y radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine for therapeutic procedures should not exceed 2 × 10–6 Ci/Ci of 90Y. In addition, there are strict requirements for the heavy metal content, which in a 90Y radiopharmaceutical in total should not exceed 10 μg per 1 Ci of 90Y [2, 3]. In order to produce the ﬁ nal product with the required purity, an 90Y multistage puriﬁ cation from chemical and radiochemical impurities is carried out, mainly by liquid extraction and ion exchange methods [1]. Each of these methods has its own limitations and disadvantages. Thus, ion-exchange methods for producing 90Y are quite simple to implement, however, the long duration of sorption processes (18–20 h) leads to signiﬁ cant losses of the ﬁ nished product due to its decomposition. In practice, isotope generators are often used. Their action is based on the sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair on a sulfonic cation exchange resin, for example, Dowex 50W×8. In this case, the 90Y yield is 90–98%, but the 90Sr impurity gradually increases due to the radiation destruction of the resin. Moreover, additional operations of chemical treatment of eluates are required to convert 90Y into a form suitable for further use (0.01 mol/dm3 HCl solution). The method of liquid extraction employing di- 2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid (D2EHPA) is currently considered the most eﬀ ective method for separating an equilibrium 90Y/90Sr mixture. The extraction proceeds rather quickly: the total time of the 90Y extraction process is 30–60 min, the yield of the target product is more than 95%, and the 90Sr content in the ﬁ nished product is less than 10–6%. However, the obtained 90Y contains, in addition to residual amounts of 90Sr, impurities of corrosion products (Fe, Ni, Cr, Pb, etc.)

Context: to organophosphate compounds, extractants based on diglycolic acid diamides, in particular, tetraoctyldiglycolamide (TODGA), can be used as an active component in the TVEX composition. DGA resin sorbent based on styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer and TODGA is produced by Triskem International (France) and is used for the extraction and separation of radioactive REE and TPE for radioanalysis [6]. There is no information on the use of TODGA- containing sorbents to produce high-purity 90Y. The nature of the REE sorption (by the example of the 152Eu sorption) on the TVEX-TODGA was previously considered in [7, 8]. Due to the fact that yttrium is a chemical analogue of REE, it can be assumed that the patterns of the europium and yttrium sorption on the studied sorbents will be similar. In the study we investigated the possibility of deep puriﬁ cation of the yttrium-90 after extraction separation of 90Y from 90Sr with D2EHPA using a TODGA-containing AXIONIT MND 40T, TVEX of Russian production, and we also studied the conditions for the sorption separation of 90Y from 90Sr using phosphate cation exchange resin and AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent.

Context: divinylbenzene copolymer was used as a carrier. The TODGA content in the sorbent was 40 wt %, the granule size was 0.315–0.50 mm. For puriﬁ cation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column lled with AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent, the volume ﬁ of the sorbent in the column was 4 cm3. Before the experiments, the sorbent was treated in a column with a 5 M nitric acid solution for 2 h. At the sorption stage the initial solution was passed through the column at a rate of 6.0 column volumes per an hour [(c.v.)/h]. The ﬁ ltrate at the column outlet was collected and tested for the amounts of chemical impurities. After the end of the sorption, a 3 M HCl solution was passed through the column at a rate of 3.0 c.v./h to remove the initial solution residues. Desorption of 90Y was performed with 0.01 M HCl. The passing rate was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. The supply of the solutions during pre-treatment and at all stages was carried out using a peristaltic pump from bottom to top. The total time of sorption puriﬁ cation was 5–6 h. Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The 90Sr/90Y pair separation experiments were carried out employing a model solution containing 1.5 g/dm3 strontium and 0.15 mg/dm3 yttrium nitrates and 0.01– 0.3 M nitric acid therewith a label of the equilibrium 90Sr/90Y pair was introduced into the model solution in an amount of about 105 Bq/dm3. At the ﬁ rst stage of separation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 D5041 phosphate cation exchange resin (Purolite, Great Britain). Then the sorbent was washed with a 0.01–0.3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 3 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined. At the second stage of separation, hydrochloric acid desorbate was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent. Then the sorbent was washed with a 3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 0.01 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined for at least 35 days. The setup scheme is shown in Fig. 1.

The dotted line is the calculated 90Y decay curve. eﬃ ciency is observed for impurities of aluminum, phosphorus, and calcium (Kpur = 2.7–3.9). During the experiments, three consecutive treatment cycles were carried out without replacing the sorbent. The results obtained showed that the puriﬁ cation factors remain at a constant level. Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The sorption method was tested for direct separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair without using the extraction method. The sorption completeness of 90Y and 90Sr on the ﬁ rst column ﬁ lled with phosphate cation exchange resin D5041 can be evidenced by the change in the relative beta activity (A/Ain) of the ﬁ ltrate over 35–50 days. The results are shown in Fig. 2a, curve 1. These results demonstrate that sorption from a 0.01 M HNO3 solution is accompanied by the combined sorption of 90Sr and 90Y. The relative beta activity of the ﬁ ltrate changes relatively little over time and its equilibrium value is about 20% of the initial value. With an increase in the nitric acid concentration the time dependence of the A/Ain value of the ﬁ ltrate changes sharply. At a 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 concentration at ﬁ rst the A/Ain value is ~0.4, and the equilibrium value, 0.8–0.9. This fact indicates that during the sorption of the equilibrium 90Sr/90Y mixture in this acidity range, almost all 90Sr remains in the ﬁ ltrate, and 90Y is completely sorbed on the column. When the sorbent is washed after sorption with 0.2–0.3 M HCl, additional elution of residual amounts of 90Sr occurs.

Context: The above is conﬁ rmed by the time dependences of the relative beta activity of hydrochloric acid desorbates (3 M) obtained after sorption with a D5041 cation exchange resin from solutions with diﬀ erent HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 2b). Figures 2b shows, for clarity, the calculated decay curve of pure radionuclide 90Y calculated according to the radioactive decay law. The results on Fig. 2b show that hydrochloric acid desorbates obtained after the 90Sr/90Y pair sorption by the D5041 cation exchange resin from 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 solutions and washing with HCl solutions of the same concentrations contain almost pure 90Y. The residual activity of desorbates after keeping for 45 days does not exceed 0.1% of the initial activity of the solution, and the experimental and calculated decomposition curves of desorbates almost completely coincide. Due to the fact that even deeper puriﬁ cation of 90Y from 90Sr is required for use in the production of radiopharmaceuticals, the obtained hydrochloric acid desorbates were subjected to additional puriﬁ cation with the TODGA-containing sorbent AXIONIT MND 40T. Sorbents of this type are capable of eﬃ cient sorption of REE and Y in strongly acidic media including hydrochloric acid. In acid solutions with a concentration of less than 0.1 M the sorption of REE(Y) sharply decreases, which makes it possible to carry out their desorption.

Context: solutions with a concentration above 3 M the complete yttrium extraction occurs, while the sorption of strontium and corrosion products on this sorbent practically does not occur. This allows at the sorption stage to carry out deep puriﬁ cation of 90Y from 90Sr and a wide range of chemical impurities (chromium, manganese, nickel, lead, iron, zirconium). The unique sorption properties of the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent make it possible to aﬀ ord pure 90Y radiopharmaceuticals without employing the extraction method that is complex in hardware implementation. At the ﬁ rst stage of the process, selective sorption of 90Y from weakly acidic media is carried out on a phosphate cation exchange resin, where the main part of 90Sr is separated and passed into the ﬁ ltrate. Desorption of 90Y from the phosphate cation exchange resin with 3 M HCl and then 90Y sorption from the hydrochloric acid desorbate on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent allow deep puriﬁ cation both from residual amounts of 90Sr and from chemical impurities of corrosion products. Elution of 90Y from the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent is easily carried out with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, which is the preferred medium for obtaining 90Y-based radiopharmaceuticals.

Context: Abstract—Recovery of lutetium and ytterbium with solutions of 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester in isopar-M and m-nitrobenzotriﬂ uoride (F3), as well as with solutions of bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid in isopar M was investigated. Using the equilibrium shift method, it was shown that ytterbium and lutetium are recovered by the cation exchange mechanism in the form of the Ln[HA2]3 adduct up to 3 M HNO3, and with a further increase in the concentration of nitric acid in an aqueous solution, the separation mechanism changes to a solvate one. The separation factors β(Lu/Yb) in the studied separation systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained data can be used for subsequent calculations of the extraction cascade for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium. Mathematical processing of experimental data was carried out to derive separation constants.

Context: Lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a therapeutic radioisotope, which is widely used for medical purposes due to optimal nuclear-physical parameters: a convenient half- life (T1/2 = 6.7 days); acceptable energy of β-particles (maximum energy 0.5 MeV), which allows destroying small tumors and metastases 1–3 mm in size without aﬀ ecting healthy tissues; soft γ-radiation emission with energy suﬃ cient to visualize and track drug migration in the patient’s body (Eγ = 113 keV (6.4%) and 208 keV (11%)) [1, 2]. The decay product of 177Lu is the stable isotope 177Hf. In addition, 177Lu has chemical properties suitable for protein labeling (e.g., dotatate peptide [3]) with bifunctional chelating agents [4]. The main method for producing a high speciﬁ c activity 177Lu preparation is neutron irradiation of the starting material containing 176Yb [5]. Irradiation of an ytterbium target highly enriched in the 176 isotope is advantageous since in this case, due to the β–decay of the 177Yb, a monoisotopic product, 177Lu, is formed. Thus, the problem of obtaining an isotopically pure target product is reduced to its separation from the target material by chemical methods. The separation of Lu from Yb is a diﬃ cult task, since both elements are lanthanides and are similar in their physicochemical properties. Therewith, even a small amount of impurities of stable isotopes of lutetium at a level of several tenths of a mass fraction can lead to a signiﬁ cant decrease in the speciﬁ c activity of 177Lu. Taking into account the rather short half-life of 177Lu, the separation should be carried out using highly selective methods: extraction or chromatography [6]. Chromatographic separation is usually employed to produce chemically pure individual elements, but such a process is unproductive: concentration to prepare fractions up to 1 g/L is diﬃ cult to enhance productivity [7].

Context: The problems of separating elements with similar chemical properties are also solved by the extraction method, in particular, when separating REE and transplutonium elements. In industry, organophosphorus (2-ethhexylphosphonic acid acids such as P507 mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) [8], Cyanex 272 (bis(2,4,4- trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid) INET-3 (2,3-dimethylbutyl)(2,4,4ꞌ-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid [11], HDEHP (di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid) [12] have recently been utilized for these purposes. It is also known that the separation of Yb/Lu by blends of extractants Cyanex 272, P507, and HDEHP exhibits a synergistic eﬀ ect [9, 13].

Context: 2-Ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (P507) is a promising extractant in the REE production, since systems based thereof have higher separation factors of lanthanides [14]. The task of the extraction method is to separate 177Lu as fast as possible because of the short half-life, from the main mass of ytterbium, ensuring the most convenient subsequent handling of the recovered lutetium. This work is aimed at assessing the possibility of using the organophosphorus extractants Р507 and Cyanex-272 for the separation of pure lutetium.

Reextraction of Lu and Yb from the organic phase was carried out with 5 M HNO3 solutions. Before taking the back extract for analysis, the samples were centrifuged to completely separate the aqueous and organic phases. Then the concentrations of ytterbium and lutetium in the back extracts were determined. Solutions of Yb and Lu metals were prepared according to the standard procedure: metal oxides (99.99%) weighed on a Mettler Toledo ML303T/A00 analytical balance (accuracy class II), were dissolved in concentrated 8 M nitric acid at heating without boiling. The solution was evaporated to dryness. After cooling, the resulting mixed salt was dissolved in 1 M HNO3, transferred into a 25-mL volumetric ﬂ ask, and made up to the mark with distilled water.

Context:  Fig. 1. Eﬀ ect of equilibrium HNO3 concentration on distribution coeﬃ cients of (а) Yb and (b) Lu at extraction with Р507 solution in isopar M. Initial REE concentration 0.2–0.4 g/L. (Point) experiment, (line) calculation. acid molecule. Most authors believe that the extractant is present in the organic phase as a dimer (HA)2 [15], since the dimerization constants of P507 and Cyanex-272 are very high (log K = 20 and 4.2, respectively [16]). In the separation of rare earth elements with P507 solutions in the range of HNO3 concentrations not higher than 4 M, a linear relationship between the logarithms of Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients and the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration is observed with a slope close to –3 (Fig. 1), which allows the reaction equation to be applied: The deviation from the linearity (Fig. 1) at a concentration of 4 M HNO3 and higher may be due to the transition to extraction by the solvate (donor- acceptor) mechanism, which occurs, for example, in the extraction of REE with HDEHP solutions from acidic media [17, 18]. It is assumed that from 1 to 3 extractant molecules take part in the formation of the solvate [19], however, in view of the insigniﬁ cance of this reaction contribution to the overall extraction mechanism and the lack of data at higher HNO3 concentrations, the value of m was taken equal to 1, as in [4].

Context: Figure 5 shows the linear relationship between the logarithms of the equilibrium constants (2) and (5) and the logarithm of the relative Р507 concentration. The values of the slope coeﬃ cients a and the values of the parameters log K0 calculated by the least squares method are presented in Table 2. Unfortunately, the derived log K0 values were found to be diﬀ erent for these two diluents, which did not allow reducing the number of parameters used. The almost parallel behavior of the curves of the REE distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the P507 concentration and the HNO3 concentration indicates that the separation factors of Yb and Lu will slightly rise with a decrease in the extractant concentration remaining in the range of 1.4–1.6 (the separation factors were derived as the ratio of the experimentally found distribution coeﬃ cients from solutions containing Yb and Lu in diﬀ erent proportions). With an increase in the HNO3 concentration in an aqueous solution, the solvate mechanism of REE extraction begins to play an increasingly important role resulting in a decrease in separation factors.

Context:  It is known that the use of bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)- phosphinic acid (Cyanex-272) as an extractant instead of P507 leads to a decrease in the REE distribution coeﬃ cients by approximately 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining high values of the separation factors [20, 21]. Therefore, it was of interest to study the regularities of Yb and Lu extraction with solutions of Cyanex-272 in isopar M. In contrast to the system with P507, the functions of the logarithms of the Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration at a concentration of less than 1 M in this system have a slope of about –2.5 (Fig. 6), which results in the need to apply for simulation of the REE extraction in this region not only Eq. (2), but also Eq. (8) derived from Eq. (1) at m = 2 and n = 1:

Context: With increasing the acid concentration in the aqueous phase above 3 M, the REE extraction brings about an increase in the distribution coeﬃ cients, which can be due to a gradual transition to the solvate mechanism of extraction. At the same time, with an increase in the concentration of Cyanex-272, the slope of the ascending section of the function of the distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the HNO3 concentration diminishes (Fig. 6), which can be described by Eqs. (5) and (9) derived from Eq. (1) at m = 1 and n = 2:

Context: The slope of the function of REE distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the Cyanex-272 concentration in isopar M at 1 and 3 M HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 7) is close to 1.6, which corresponds to the cumulative proceeding of reactions (2), (5), (8), and (9). The slope coeﬃ cients a and the parameters log K0 of Eq. (7) presented in Table 1 evidence that the values of the parameters a of Eq. (7) practically do not diﬀ er for Yb and Lu, which notices that the separation factors of these elements are independent of the extractant concentration. The equilibrium constants of Eqs. (5) and (9) for Yb and Lu coincide and practically do not depend on the extractant concentration, which conﬁ rms the decrease in the separation factors of these elements at HNO3 concentrations above 2 M. At a lower concentration, the separation factors of the Yb/Lu pair increase and reach 1.4–1.6, which makes it possible to consider this extractant as an alternative to P507. At the same time, the low saturation of Cyanex-272 (Fig. 2) necessitates the use of Cyanex-272 only in a mixture with other extractants. The average error in calculating the distribution coeﬃ cients according to the model does not exceed 7–8 rel %.

Context:  Extraction systems for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium based on acidic organophosphorus extractants P507 and Cyanex-272 from nitric acid solutions have been studied. In the course of the experiments, results were found both with the use of a light diluent (Isopar M) and a heavy diluent F3. The separation factors of lutetium and ytterbium in the studied extraction systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained experimental data on the extraction of lutetium and ytterbium with P507 were used to construct a mathematical model that makes it possible to predict the behavior of Yb and Lu in the extraction cascade. A special report will be devoted to testing technological regimes for the lutetium and ytterbium separation.
