Context: Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) such as trialkyl phosphates and trialkylphosphine oxides can be used as extractants. Trialkyl phosphates are well known as eﬀ ective extractants and are used for recovering many acids and salts, whereas trialkylphosphine oxides have been studied in this respect to a lesser extent, and their extracting and separating power is of large interest. To reach the maximum eﬃ cient isotope separation by liquid extraction in a multistep process, the substance distribution ratio should be as close to 1 as possible. The distribution ratio D is described by the equation

Context: Vigorous progress of such ﬁ elds as nuclear power engineering, medicine, and instrument making makes it necessary to develop and produce specialty materials enriched in certain isotopes of various chemical elements. In particular, the boron isotope 10В, which has high cross section of thermal neutron capture, is a valuable constituent of many materials. For example, materials based on 10B are demanded in nuclear power engineering, namely, in reactor control and protection systems and in production of steel for transportation racks and containers for spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Boron-10 is used in neutron capture therapy for cancer treatment. High demand for materials enriched in 10B and insuﬃ cient scale of their production make it topical to search for, study, and develop more eﬃ cient and environmentally safe procedures for boron isotope separation. Methods based on chemical isotope exchange, when isotope eﬀ ects inﬂ uence the properties of complexes of the extractive compound and extractant, are candidate separation methods. The “anisole process” is the most known and eﬃ cient among such methods. It is based on the reaction of gaseous BF3 with anisole CH3ОC6H5 to form the complex CH3ОC6H5∙BF3(l). This complex

Context: We determined the distribution ratios for each extraction system. The highest distribution ratio D is reached in the HBF4–TAPO system: 1.5 at low acid concentrations. High distribution ratio D is an advantage in commercial separation of boron isotopes, because at one extraction step the larger fraction of the substance is extracted, and thus the amount of the enriched product obtained increases.

Context: Variation of the extractants inﬂ uences the isotope separation not so strongly as the kind of the extractable substance does. The isotope separation factors in the HBF4-TBP and HBF4–TAPO systems are close and coincide within the uncertainty. The kind of the extractant inﬂ uences to a greater extent the degree of extraction of the acid from the aqueous phase into the organic phase than the isotope eﬀ ects. Studies of extraction isotherms have shown that the HBF4–TAPO system gives the highest distribution ratio despite the 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 n* aq ((cid:572)), mM Fig. 1. Isotherms of boric acid extraction with TBP and TAPO. (1) Extraction of H3BO3 with 0.5 M TAPO in o-xylene, (2) Extraction of H3BO3 with 1.5 M TBP in o-xylene. The extraction mechanism in each system was determined from the shape of the extraction isotherm. In the H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TBP, H3BO3∙C4H6O6–TAPO, and HBF4–TBP systems, the substance distribution is mainly physical. In the HBF4–TAPO system, the extraction occurs by the chemical mechanism with the chemical interaction between HBF4 and TAPO. The chemical interaction between the system components is 1 2

As a ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation stage, the Fe impurity was separated by sorption from 9 M HCl on Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (50–100 mesh). from Pu and Fe. Microamounts of Pu were separated from Am and Cm by sorption of Pu on a strongly basic anion exchange resin Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 (50–100 mesh) from 9 M HCl in the presence of 0.1 M H2O2 [20]. Americium and curium are practically not sorbed by the resin under these conditions. Puriﬁ cation in a hydrochloric acid medium is recommended in the presence of Fe(III) salts, since it allows achievement of simultaneous separation of Am and Cm from Pu and Fe.

Context:  The results in Tables 1–4 show that with an increase in the α-HIBA concentration at the second stage of the stepwise elution process, the width of the chromato- graphic peak at the base diminishes and the number of theoretical plates rises, i.e., peak blurring is reduced. At the same time, the selectivity α and the resolution RS de- crease, i.e., the overlapping degree of chromatographic peaks increases. It was noted in [25] that two substances will be separated if the selectivity α > 1; for a satisfac- tory separation, RS must be equal to 1. The separation is considered complete if RS is equal to or greater than 1.5. Therefore, the Cm and Am separation, as well as their puriﬁ cation from Eu and Cf, is recommended to be carried out by stepwise elution with 0.1 M (pH 5.0) and 0.15 M (pH 5.0) α-HIBA ammonium salt solutions at the ﬁ rst and second stage, respectively.

The radiometric methods used in this work show no Pu isotopes in the initial solution (the Pu content is below the detection limits), so the preliminary Pu separation on an anion exchange resin was not performed. A mixture of 248Cm, 241Am, and 249Cf radionuclides was separated on a column containing 10 cm3 of strongly acid Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 cation exchange + form.

Context: Fig. 4. Output curves of elution of weight amounts of 248Cm (248Cm 26.6 mg, 241Am 3.3 × 106 Bq, 249Cf 3.6 × 105 Bq) with α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, pH 5.0. At low concentrations, the amount of sorbed substance is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase, and a linear sorption isotherm is observed (the distribu- tion coeﬃ cient does not depend on the concentration of the substance in the liquid phase). Each component of the zone moves at a constant rate, since the linear rate of its migration depends on the ﬂ ow rate of the mobile phase, which is set constant. The entire zone moves with the same rate, remaining symmetrical: the concentration of the component is maximum in the center of the zone and decreases symmetrically towards the edges. There- fore, the peak on the chromatogram is also symmetrical (Figs. 1–3). If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeﬃ cient is greater than for low concentra- tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra- tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm). As a result, the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred and the peak is asymmetric. Since the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred when Am and Cf are removed from Am and Cf (Fig. 4), it can be assumed that the Cm sorption isotherm has a concave character. For a concave isotherm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diﬀ use leading edge; the retained volume increases with increasing ion concentration. For the speciﬁ ed Cm weight, the following charac- teristics were experimentally determined: the retention volume V = 35.4 c.v., the width of the chromatographic peak at the base W = 6.1 c.v., the dynamic (volumetric) distribution coeﬃ cient D = 35, the number of theoreti- cal plates N = 539. Comparison with the experimental results with indicator amounts of 244Cm (Table 2) shows that the number of theoretical plates N decreased when purifying the weight amounts of Cm. The result ob- tained agrees with the data of [9], in which the eluative separation of Am and Cm on a sulfonic cation exchange resin with α-HIBA was studied. It was shown in [9] that with an increase in the initial loading of the column with the mixture to be separated, the chromatographic sepa- ration eﬃ ciency of Am and Cm decreases (the number N of theoretical plates decreases). Using the developed technology, for the ﬁ rst time at RIAR, a 248Cm radionuclide material with a radionuclide and chemical purity signiﬁ cantly exceeding the indicators of preparations obtained using standard technology was produced [1–3]. The characteristics of the 248Cm preparation are as follows: the content of ﬁ ssion products (an activity fraction of the target radionuclide) ≤2.1%, the weight fraction of non-radioactive impurities ≤1.0%, the weight fraction of 248Cm in a mixture of curium isotopes 94.99%.

Context: Abstract—Lead-203 was produced by proton bombardment of natural thallium target. For producing 203Pb, natTl was electroplated on copper backing as target and was bombarded by energetic proton beam. After bom- bardment, the target was dissolved in 1 M HNO3. Ion exchange, solvent extraction, and nanomagnetic ion-imprinted polymer methods were used for separating 203Pb from thallium. The separation efficiency of these methods was studied. γ-Ray spectroscopy was applied for evaluating 203Pb and others radionuclides. The separation efficiency was determined from the γ-ray spectra. The separation efficiency of the methods us- ing ion exchange, solvent extraction, and nanomagnetic ion-imprinted adsorbent was 98, 99.3, and 96.4%, re- spectively.

Context: Materials and equipment. Thallium(I) sulfate (99.9%) was purchased from UCB (Union Chimique Belge). Lead nitrate was purchased from Fluka. Stan- dard 1000 mg L−1 solutions of lead and thallium were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. All the other chemi- cals were purchased from Merck. Cu backings were produced in our workshop. All chemicals used in this study were analytical grade and were used without fur- ther purification. Working solutions of Pb and Tl were prepared by diluting appropriate amounts of the stock solutions. A Hydro Ultrapure water purification system was used for making deionized water needed to prepare all the required solutions. An HPGe detector system (CanberraTM, GC1020-7500SL) in conjugation with a PC-based MCA and A Metrohm 827 pH meter was used. Target preparation. Natural thallium(I) sulfate (Tl2SO4), was chosen as the target material. High- quality thallium targets (70 μm) were prepared by elec- trodeposition of 1 g of Tl on 12 cm2 copper backings. The first plating bath is prepared by dissolving a por- tion of natTl2SO4 in an aqueous alkaline solution con- taining EDTA as a complexing agent, hydrazine hy- drate as an anodic depolarizer, and Brij-35 as a wetting agent. Constant-current electrolysis was carried out by applying a bipolar chopped saw-tooth voltage between the Pt anode and copper cathode. Target irradiation.

Context:  The total amount of 203Pb before and after separa- tion was determined in all cases by the region of inter- est (ROI) values. The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods. The irradiation yield is 2.2 mCi μA–1 h–1.

Context: Studies concerned with the possibility of targeted delivery of actinium examined the sorption of 225Ac on various supports in radiopharmpreparations. For example, it has been shown that it is possible to use liposomal carriers [11–14] or nanoparticles based on inorganic substances: LaPO4 [15–19], InPO4 [20], GdVO4 [21], and TiO2 [22]. At the same time, application of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) seems to be promising because of the important properties: potential biocompatibility of their separate forms, accessibility in industrial amounts, low cost as compared with vector molecules, and the possibility of varying their biodistribution upon an appropriate modiﬁ cation. However, the evidence about using CNMs as actinium supports is extremely scarce [23, 24]. In this context, the goal of the present study was to develop a method for quantitative isolation of 228Ac as a product of 228Ra decay from natural thorium, with their subsequent separation and using the isolated 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state to examine the sorption of actinium on CNM sample with varied structure and physicochemical properties.

Context:  mixture was kept for one month till the complete decay of 224Ra. In the ﬁ nal stage, 228Ac was separated from 228Ra, 208Pb, and newly formed 228Th. For this purpose, a solution of 228Ra in HNO3 was evaporated to dryness in a glass ﬂ ask on an electric hot plate, dissolved in 4 M HNO3; and the solution was placed in a column with RE extraction-chromatographic sorbent (Triskem Int., France, based on carbamoylmethylphosphine oxide and tributyl phosphate) with volume of 2 mL. 228Ra and 228Ac were separated by selective elution from the column: ﬁ rst, 228Ra was eluted with a 4 M HNO3 solution, and then 228Ac, in 0.05 M HNO3, with fractions collected each having a volume of 1 mL The purity of 228Ac was determined by registering its gamma- spectrum during three days. To perform experiments on sorption of actinium on CNMs, the 228Ac eluate in 0.05 M HNO3 was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in several mL of a phosphate buﬀ ered saline (PBS) with pH 7. Gamma-spectrometry. The content of thorium, radium, and actinium, in the samples was found by the gamma-spectrometry on a spectrometer equipped with a GR 3818 high-purity germanium detector (Canberra Industries, United States). Thorium was identiﬁ ed by the gamma-peak of 228Th with energy of 84.4 keV. The content of 228Ra was determined by using the additionally introduced gamma-emitting 226Ra (186 keV, 3.6%) obtained via dissolution of 226RaBr2 in 0.01 M HCl. 228Ac was determined from the lines at 338 (11.3%) and 911 (25.8%) keV. Characterization of CNMs. We used in the study the following commercial samples of CNMs: powdered detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) of UDA-TAN brand (Federal State Unitary Enterprise SKTB Tekhnolog, Russia), aqueous suspension of partly reuced graphite oxide (GO), and powdered multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (Nanotekhtsentr OOO, Tambov, Russia). The morphology of CNM particles was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on a JEM-2100F/Cs/GIF instrument (JEOL, Japan). The speciﬁ c surface of the CNMs was determined by the method of thermal desorption of nitrogen in terms of the BET model. The content of impurity elements in the CNMs was found by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP- MS) (X Series 2, Thermo Scientiﬁ c, United States). The elemental composition of the CNM surface was determined by the method of X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) (Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical, Great Britain). The hydrodynamic diameter of CNM particles in hydrosols was determined by the method of dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Red Badge, 633 nm) ZEN 3600 analyzer (Malvern Instruments, United States). Acid functional groups on the CNM surface were determined by potentiometric titration. The surface of the CNM samples was modiﬁ ed by the procedures described in [29, 30]. DNDs were oxidized in a 3 : 1 mixture H2SO4/HNO3 at 120°C for 24 h, and GO and MWCNTs were hydrogenated in the Ar + 10% H2 atmosphere at 800°C for 5 h. Study of the sorption behavior of 228Ac on CNM. In a study of the sorption of Ac(III) on CNMs, a 100-μL portion of a CNM suspension was placed in polypropylene test tubes with a cover, and 900 μL of the resulting solution of 228Ac was added. The test tubes were shaken on a TS-100 shaker (Biosan, Latvia), and after that the mixture was centrifuged on a CM-50 centrifuge (Eppendorf, United States) for 20 min at 18000 g. Then, the gamma-spectrum of the 228Ac solution was recorded, and the counting rate of an aliquot of the solution was compared with that for a reference sample. To determine the amount of desorption, to the solution and precipitate remaining in the test tube was added a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, with the content of BSA in the resulting solution being 40 g/L. The contents of the test tube were stirred up and placed on a shaker, after which the phases were separated by centrifuging for subsequent radiometric measurements.

Context:  Fig. 2. Extractive-chromatographic separation of 228Ra and 228Ac on RE sorbent in HNO3. Column volume 2 mL, diameter 0.7 cm. Fig. 3. Kinetics of Ac(III) sorption on CNM in PBS at 25°C, m/V ratio 100 μg/mL. found here that the yield of 228Ac is nearly quantitative (not less than 95% relative to the amount placed on the column), with the separation factor of 228Ra and 228Ac being 2.2 × 104. According to [31], 208Pb is eluted from the column together with 228Ra. Thus, we developed a method for separation 228Ac in the radiochemically pure state from large amounts of natural thorium. The isolated 228Ac can be used in scientiﬁ c studies, including in vivo experiments. It was found that, with the developed method implemented, the loss of 228Ra does not exceed 0.005% of the amount placed in the column. Therefore, the starting 228Ra preparation can be repeatedly used. For this purpose, the fractions from 1 to 9 mL were evaporated and again dissolved in 1 mL of 4 M HNO3. It was shown that the results are reproducible because 228Ac could be eluted from the generator we developed not less than 20 times. In a prolonged use of the solution of 228Ra, there occurs accumulation of 228Th occurs due to the decay of 228Ac, but 228Th is quantitatively sorbed on the column with RE in the process of separation of 228Ra and 228Ac [31]. It is supposed that the columns with the sorbent are intended for single use, and, therefore, 228Th does not contaminate the solution of 228Ac being prepared. In the many-years use of the generator, the extract of 232Th can be repeatedly used to extract 228Ra accumulated in it.

Context: metabolites are 2-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid [14, 15]. Elimination of atorvastatin occurs from the systemic circulation through the liver via the bile into the feces and through the kidneys via the renal- urinary system [16–19]. Most of the hepatobiliary radiopharmaceuticals available for imaging are labeled with 99mTc. They exhibit identical pharmacokinetic properties in animals. They are eﬃ ciently removed from the blood by the liver and excreted into the bile. Moreover, they diagnose diseases of hepatocytic function and the functional status of the cystic duct and the gallbladder [6]. The mechanism of in situ oxidative radioiodination using chloramine-T (CAT), involving the formation of iodine monochloride (ICl), was elucidated [20, 21]. In weakly acidic media, CAT dissociates to ArSO2NCl– anion, which may react directly with iodide to form ICl. Subsequently the iodine monochloride (ICl) reacts with any position in the target molecule that can experience electrophilic substitution [20, 22]. Owing to the diﬀ erence in the electronegativity between iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and acts as a source of iodonium ion (I+). Therefore, aromatic electrophilic labeling with electropositive radioiodide usually proceeds in high radiochemical yield compared to 50% yield if molecular

Context:  Synthesis of 125I-atorvastatin was carried out by direct electrophilic substitution with no-carrier-added 125I (T1/2 = 60 days) under oxidative conditions in the presence of CAT. The presumable reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The TLC results show that radioiodide stayed near the origin (Rf = 0–0.1), while 125I-atorvastatin proceeded with the solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1). The radiolabeling yield was 94.3 ± 1.4% (n = 5). It was determined by HPLC analysis, where the retention times of free iodide and 125I-atorvastatin were 1.5 and 4.6 min, respectively, as given in the chromatogram (Fig. 1). The HPLC system allowed the separation of the radiolabeled compound from the free radioiodide and the unlabeled atorvastatin as well as the puriﬁ cation and quality control of the radiolabeled compound. The in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compound was considered in order to estimate the appropriate time for injection to exclude the formation of unacceptable products resulting from the radiolysis of 125I-atorvastatin. These products might be accumulated in non-target organs. As we found, 125I-atorvastatin was stable for up to 24 h. The lipophilicity was determined by measuring the distribution of 125I-atorvastatin between n-octanol and

With an increase in the amount of atorvastatin from 25 to 50 μg (0.45–0.9 mM), the radiochemical yield increased from 85 to 94.3 ± 1.4%. Further increase in the amount of atorvastatin beyond 50 μg had no eﬀ ect on the labeling yield; i.e., the amount of 50 μg is suﬃ cient to capture all the produced iodonium ions. Eﬀ ect of CAT concentration. The eﬀ ect of CAT concentration on the radiochemical yield of 125I-atorvastatin is shown in Fig. 3. High radiochemical yield (94.3 ± 1.4%) was attained with an increase in the CAT concentration from 3 to 13 mM at pH 5 and 30 min reaction time. Further increase in the oxidizing agent concentration over 13 mM decreases the radioiodination yield due to the production of undesirable oxidation by- products as a result of denaturation and chlorination of atorvastatin exposed to high concentration of CAT for a relatively long time. Eﬀ ect of reaction time. Chloramine-T is a powerful oxidant, and it may cause oxidative damage of sensitive biological substrates or targets if overexposed. Therefore, the radiochemical reaction should be quenched by adding a reductant such as sodium metabisulﬁ te. It reduces hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion, thus

Context: The 64Ni targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the enriched 64Ni (99.32%) solution prepared as described above. Electroplating of 64Ni was realized using a plating vessel of our own design and manufacture (Figure 1), where the Au disk was used as a cathode and platinum wire as an anode. The electrodeposition of 64Ni was achieved at 2.4–2.6 V and 15–25 mA with the platinum anode at ~1 cm from the Au disk electrode. This process took 48–72 h. The enriched 64Ni target was irradiated at 12.5 MeV (which decreased by Al) with 20 µA current on a Sumitomo HM-20 cyclotron (20 MeV) for about 5–7 h. 64Cu was produced from the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction.

Context: Uranium was determined by the spectrophotometric measurement of the light absorption of the uranium com- plex with arsenazo III; plutonium, by α-spectrometry; and ﬁ ssion products, by the atomic emission spectral method. The testing procedure is described in detail in [2]. At the ﬁ nal stage, 8 M HNO3 solution (200 mL) was added to a ﬂ ask with an undissolved fuel cladding, and control dissolution was carried out at a temperature of 95–100°C for 5 h. Upon dissolution process completion the α- and γ-spectrometric analyzes of the solutions were performed after the main and control dissolutions. The analytical line energies of radionuclides, their yields, as well as the half-lives for calculating the speciﬁ c activities of radionuclides when calculating their volumetric activity in term of concentration, were taken from [7, 8]. The isolation and puriﬁ cation of elements was car- ried out using a combination of cation-, anion-exchange, and extraction chromatograpy. The techniques devel- oped at RIAR were taken as the basis for the separation of SNF components. The isotopic composition of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, and Cm was determined in the isolated fractions. The analysis procedure is described in detail in [2–6, 9–11]. Quantitative determination of the U, Pu, Nd content was carried out by repeating the procedure for their isolation in the presence of a complex label by isotope dilution with mass spectrometric ending. To ﬁ nd the fuel burn-up depth, the value of 148Nd accumulation and the total 145Nd and 146Nd accumulation were used as monitors. When analyzing a sample of SNF MNUP irradiated as part of KETVS-1, aliquots were taken from the

Context:  be 8.2 × 103 Bq, and the 129I speciﬁ c activity will be 41 Bq/mL. For radiochemical studies of SNF samples, a hundredfold dilution of the initial solution is utilizsed. We failed to determine the 129I content in a dilute solution against the background of other SNF components. For detecting iodine, it is necessary to develop special procedures for its isolation from a SNF sample. The results of determining the isotopic composition and weight content of the nuclides U, Pu, Nd, Am, Cm in the MNUP SNF are given in Table 4. In parentheses are the values of the total absolute error in units of the last digits of the result for a conﬁ dence level of 0.95. When ﬁ ltering the MNUP SNF solution through a double cellulose ﬁ lter, a light gray coating was observed on the upper ﬁ lter. The sediment weight could not be ﬁ xed, since the initial weight of the cellulose ﬁ lter turned out to be greater than the weight of the ﬁ lter with sediment. This experimental fact is probably associated with the destruction of cellulose under the action of α- and γ-emitting nuclides. According to the data of [19–21], the sediment weight upon uranium oxide SNF dissolution in nitric acid is no more than 0.6% of the dissolved fuel weight. It was found in [22] that, upon dissolution of irradiated mixed-oxide fuel with a burn- up of 31.7 to 54.7 GW/t in 3 HNO3 at 95°С, the the undissolved sediment weight does not exceed 1.3% of the SNF weight. When studying the dissolution of model nitride SNF [23], the volumes of 7.8 and 9.44 M HNO3 required for dissolution were calculated based on the nal concentration of metals in the solution: 280 and ﬁ 400 g/L, respectively. It is shown that the weight of the undissolved residue is 1.8 and 2.26%, respectively. The results of detecting the content of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the solution and the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 5. The presence of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr was registered only on the upper cellulose ﬁ lter; there were no these elements on the lower ﬁ lter. The content of these elements in the solution obtained after the dissolution of the upper ﬁ lter was equivalent to their content in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF. The total weight of Mo, Pd, Rh, Zr in the undissolved residue of MNUP SNF irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 was 0.0019 g, which is 0.07% of the dissolved SNF weight. The results of determining the uranium and plutonium content in the undissolved residue of the MNUP fuel irradiated in the BN-600 reactor as part of KETVS-1 are presented in Table 6. The data in Table 6 indicate that the U and Pu contents in the upper and lower ﬁ lters are comparable. The close values of these quantities evidence that most of the U and Pu we found in solutions after the dissolution of the lters were sorbed by cellulose. ﬁ The excess of the U content in the upper ﬁ lter compared to the lower ﬁ lter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds. The weight of undissolved U estimated from the diﬀ erence between the U weight on the upper and lower ﬁ lters, is 2.5 mg, or 0.09% of the total uranium content in the analyzed SNF sample.

Context:  Using the table above, it can be suggested that for the production of cobalt-55, iron-54 targets should be utilized based on the lack of potential long-lived radio-contaminants co-produced, and an increased yield at lower thickness targets when compared to yields produced by nickel-58. To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelera- tor capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

Context: Targets of nickel and iron are relatively easy to fabricate; most literature reports describe electrochemical preparations because of the thermal and electrical conductivity of the resulting metal deposits, and presumably due to their compatibility with efforts to reuse costly separated materials. Nickel powder, natural or enriched, can be plated onto a silver or gold backings via electrodeposition with ﬁnal deposited nickel masses between 45 and 200 mg [14,26]. The procedure follows closely to the methods for plating nickel-64 for the production of copper- 64 [90,91]. In a generally representative process, nickel-58 powder is dissolved in 6 M HNO3, dried and reconstituted in 2.3 mL of 2.4 M H2SO4. The plating solution is adjusted pH 9 using 28% NH4OH and 270–300 mg of (NH4)2SO4 and transferred to a circular elec- troplating cell that consists of a Teﬂon base that is connected to the gold coin, allowing for a 5 mm plating diameter [26]. With graphite or platinum anodes, a DC voltage of 2.5–3.6 V is applied, producing currents ranging from 8 to 116 mA. Masses of 45–55 mg are deposited in ~12 h and larger masses (100–200 mg) take 2–3 days to quantitatively electroplate onto the cathode [14,26] leaving a clear and colorless electrolyte behind. Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 µL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell. Thisgaard et al. explains a different method for electroplating iron powder, adapted from Zaman and Qaim [28]. In this method, iron powder is dissolved in 1 mL of H2SO4 under nitrogen-atmosphere. once dissolved, the solution is diluted with distilled water to 5 mL in order to have a pH of 1.5. This solution is then used for the plating process on a silver backing, where the current density is reported as 28–35 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h with a ﬁxed voltage of 7.3 V. [87]. Another form of target fabrication is to press elemental enriched iron into 5 mm diameter pellets. Enriched iron material can come in the form of Fe2O3. If made from the oxide form, the target will have poor thermal conductivity. Therefore, the enriched Fe2O3 is reduced to elemental form by heating the powder at 800 ◦C for 4 h in a hydrogen tube furnace [86].

Context:  The separation of cobalt-5x from iron-5x uses a two column technique, as shown in Figure 18. An AG1X8 anion-exchange resin packed column is used for the bulk separation of iron and cobalt, then a DGA column serves as a “clean up” to further improve the puriﬁcation of cobalt-5x [26]. While there has not been a publication speciﬁcally on the separation of manganese target material from cobalt-55,58m, the work performed by Pourmand et al. suggests branched DGA can also be used for radio-chemical isolation using 4–6 M HCl, where in this range manganese 2+ has minimal afﬁnity for the resin, and cobalt 2+ has a greater afﬁnity [95].

Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popu- lar imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist pep- tides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding afﬁnity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding afﬁnity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110]. The ﬁrst cobalt-55 imaging of GRPR was reported in 2016 by Dam et al. [111] and compared 55Co-, 57Co-, and 68Ga-labeled GRPR agonist NOTA-AMBA (NOTA-Gly-4-ABz- Gln-Trp-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) in a PC3 prostate cancer. 57Co- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA-AMBA were found to have similar receptor afﬁnities, serum stabilities, and phar- macokinetics at 1 h and 4 h PI [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA enabled PET imaging at a 24 h timepoint (and beyond) which is not possible with [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-AMBA and revealed encouraging clearance of the tracer and stable late uptake of [5xCo]Co-NOTA-AMBA in the tumor [111]. In 2017, Mitran et al. reported radiolabeling GRPR antagonist RM26 (NOTA-PEG2- [D-Phe, Sta, Leu] bombesin [6–14]) with cobalt-55 and cobalt-57 [13]. Cell binding and internalization were investigated in PC3 cells and a mouse PC3 xenograft tumor model. They observed 12% cell internalization at 24 h which is similar to what has been reported for [111In]In-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 [112]. Biodistribution studies in PC3 tumor-bearing mice showed that at 3 h PI the tumor uptake was greater than uptake in any other organ including the kidneys. PET imaging studies using [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 showed clear tumor uptake at 3 h PI and by 24 h PI the tumor showed high uptake (Figure 20). The IC50 for Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (5.54 ± 0.4 nM) [10] is approximately 10-fold higher than Co-NOTA-AMBA (0.46 ± 0.20 nM) [13,111]. In vivo comparisons between [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA and [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 are complicated as the early imaging times are not matched between studies. However, comparison at the 24 h timepoint shows greater uptake of [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA than [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 in the tumor as well as many other organs. Even though the tumor uptake was less, the tumor to organ ratios for [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 were sometimes 100-fold greater than what was observed with [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. This was most notable in tissues with high GRPR expression such as the colon, pancreas, and stomach. The 24 h PI PET images provided, with both papers similarly showing lower non-target organ accumulation with the [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 than with [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. Recently, Mitran et al. investigated the impact chelator modiﬁcation had on PEG2- RM26 cell binding, internalization, and biodistribution in PC-3 prostate cancer [113]. PEG2- RM26 was bound to NOTA, DOTA, NODAGA, or DOTAGA and radiolabeled with cobalt- 55 and cobalt-57. The NOTA- and DOTA-labeled peptides showed the highest uptake in PC-3 cells in vitro and DOTA-labeled peptide had the highest tumor uptake in vivo by 24 h PI. In PET imaging studies, NOTA and DOTA PEG2-RM26 showed near-complete clearance of the radiotracer from the kidneys and GI tract by 24 h, whereas NODAGA and DOTAGA had residual GI and kidney uptake respectively.

Context: Abstract—The possibility of producing 225Ac and 223Ra by irradiation of natural 232Th with medium-energy protons was examined. Thorium foils were irradiated with 90-, 110-, and 135-MeV protons at the accelerator of the Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Troitsk (Moscow oblast). The cumulative production cross sections for 225Ac were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, and for 227Th (223Ra precursor), 43 ± 5, 37 ± 6, and 35 ± 4 mb, respectively. Based on the experimental data and theoretical calculations, the possible yields of 225Ac and 223Ra in irradiation of thick thorium targets at various accelerators were deter- mined. An efficient procedure was suggested for isolating the products from the irradiated targets: 225Ac, by liquid extraction and extraction chromatography, and 223Ra, by sublimation from a thorium–lanthanum melt followed by thermochromatographic separation in metallic titanium columns and extraction-chromatographic isolation of radium. The procedure allows production of large (units of curies) amounts of radiochemically pure 225Ac and 223Ra, which is promising for wide use of these radionuclides in nuclear medicine.

Context: targets by their irradiation with fast or thermal neu- trons [7, 8], γ-quanta [9], or accelerated protons or other charged particles [10, 11]. The starting 226Ra is also difficultly available. In addition, radium targets of relatively large mass are dangerous in handling, which gives rise to serious problems in their wide application, especially in cases when radium regeneration from the irradiated targets is required. Another radionuclide promising for medicine is 223Ra (T1/2 = 11.4 days). It is directly used for therapy of bone tumor diseases [12]. It can also serve as a source of 211Pb (T1/2 = 36 min) in generators [13]. The common route to small amounts of 223Ra is its isolation from 235U decay products. Large amounts of 223Ra can be produced by irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reac- tor, followed by chemical isolation of the formed 227Ac (T1/2 = 21.8 years) decaying into 227Th (T1/2 = 18.7 days) and then into 223Ra. As already noted, irra- diation and processing of a radium target involve seri- ous problems.

Irradiated Th metal foils were dissolved in concentrated HNO3, the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 3–8 M HNO3, and Th was extracted with two portions of 1–5 M TBP or 0.1–0.5 M TOPO solution in toluene [21]. After the Th extraction, the aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness, concentrated HClO4 was added, and the solu- tion was evaporated to dryness to remove Ru isotopes. For further purification, the residue was dissolved in 5 M HNO3 and subjected to extraction chromatogra- phy in 5 M HNO3 in a column (volume 2.5 ml) packed with a sorbent based on octylphenyl-N,N-di- (TRU- isobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide resin®, Eichrom Technologies, Inc.)

Chemical isolation of Ra from irra- diated metallic Th was performed by a gas-chemical method. For this purpose, a piece of irradiated thorium foil (3 mg) together with metallic La (280 mg) was placed in a crucible of metallic Zr. Addition of La (Тm = 918°С) leads to formation of a melt with Th (for Th, Тm = 1755°С), and in the liquid metal diffusion and, correspondingly, release of the sublimed micro- elements are considerably faster than in solid Th. The crucible was heated for 1 h in succession at 970, 1040, 1130, 1190, 1270°С in a stream of helium purified with a titanium getter (the heating temperature was determined with an accuracy of ±15°С).

Thus, the experimentally measured production cross sections are cumulative, and they cannot be accurate, because the production cross sections of the parent 225Th, 225Ra, 229Pa, and 225Ra were not determined sufficiently reliably. Never- theless, these cumulative cross sections allow estima- tion of 225Ac yields in irradiation of targets in different ranges of proton energy. The 225Ac production cross sections that we calcu- lated from γ-ray spectrometric data are plotted in Fig. 4 in comparison with the theoretical values obtained us- ing different models: ALICE (ALICE-IPPE version) and cascade evaporation (СЕF). For the proton ener- gies of 90, 110, and 135 MeV, the experimental cross sections were 6.7 ± 0.9, 9.8 ± 1.9, and 13.9 ± 1.5 mb, respectively.

Apparently, Ra, Ba, Sr, Be, Cs, and Cd are transported along the thermochromatographic column in the ele- mentary state, whereas I and Br form compounds with Ti. As can be seen, by depositing the sublimed ele- ments on the Ti collector in the temperature range 1100–600°С (the range is refined depending on the isolation conditions), it is possible to obtain a fraction of Ra containing only Ва and Sr impurities. The subsequent extraction-chromatographic purifi- cation of this fraction allows us to obtain a fraction of pure Ra containing 223Ra with impurities of 225Ra and 224Ra (Fig. 3c). Thus, we have developed an efficient procedure for isolating 225Ac and 223Ra from metallic Th irradiated with medium-energy accelerated protons.

Context:  Cadmium-109 is used for fabricating reference ion- izing radiation sources. It can be produced by neutron irradiation of silver. In irradiation of the starting material with >98% enrichment for 6 months in the SM reactor with ther- mal neutrons at a flux density of 1 × 1015 n cm–2 s–1, the total yield of all the Cd isotopes is about 50% rela- tive to the initial silver weight; the specific activity of 109Cd is 4–4.2 Ci g–1. The production of the desired radionuclide is accompanied by the production of a significant amount of 110mAg. The subsequent radio- chemical processing of the irradiated sample is per- formed to remove 110mAg from 109Cd, obtain the re- quired chemical form of the product, and regenerate expensive 107Ag for the repeated irradiation. The 110mAg/109Cd activity ratio in the final product should not exceed 3 × 10–4%. Extensive experimental data are available on the separation of Ag and Cd by ion exchange, extraction, and selective precipitation of Ag [1, 2]. The over- whelming majority of methods are methods of analyti- cal chemistry, unsuitable for operation with gram amounts of Ag and Cd in hot cells under the conditions of remote control. Only the precipitation methods based on precipitation of poorly soluble silver halides or of Ag metal after the silver reduction are an excep- tion. We believe that the precipitation of Ag metal, which is a compact readily settling powder that can be readily washed, is the easiest in implementation. This method was used for isolation and purification of 109Cd [3]; silver was precipitated from 0.1–2 M HNO3 in the presence of NaNO3 on SKN carbon sorbent. At equal initial activity of 109Cd and 110mAg, the Cd/Ag separa- tion factor was approximately 500–800. Final purifica- tion of Cd to remove Ag was performed by isotope dilution of Ag, followed by the AgCl precipitation. In contrast to [3], in numerous procedures for re- covering Ag from wastes the reduction, as a rule, is performed in weakly alkaline or ammonia solutions, because specifically in these media it is most complete [4]. This study was aimed at developing a procedure for Cd purification to remove Ag in one process cycle by reduction and precipitation of Ag from ammonia solutions, followed by the Cd concentration in the form convenient for the subsequent preparation of the 109Cd product (hydrochloric acid solution with preset HCl concentration). We chose as reductant hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS), which does not react with Cd. The precipitated Ag metal is the ready starting product for fabricating targets. Then, Cd is precipitated from the mother liquor in the form of basic cadmium carbonate, which is then readily dissolved in hydrochloric acid. In this study, we determined the conditions for the most complete reduction of Ag and precipitation of basic cadmium carbonate from ammonia solutions.

For the efficient separation of Ag and Cd, it is necessary to find conditions at which Cd would completely occur in the carbonate precipitate and Ag would occur in the solution the ammine complex. Apparently, the minimal concentration of ammonia should be sufficient for dissolving Ag and Cd nitrates with the formation of the corresponding soluble ammine complexes of Ag and Cd. The maximal concentration of ammonia should be so as to allow no less than 95% precipitation of cadmium carbonate.

Context: Cadmium-109 has found application in physiological research on animals and plants for more than forty years informations. This which has provided useful radionuclide can probably be used for inhibition of liver cancerous cells,12,13 as well as for tissue imaging with computed SPECT (single photon tomography).14 Additionally, to investigate the ecosystem.15 emission it can be used The production of 109Cd with a proton beam can be performed by reactions: In+p,16 that needs an energy of about 96 MeV, Ag+d17 with energy 13.4 MeV and Ag+p,18,19 with an energy range between 14 and 9 MeV. Cyclotron is ideal for this work. Accelerator production of 109Cd is largely achieved via nuclear reactions 109Ag(p,n)109Cd and 109Ag(d,2n)109Cd which are well suited for medium to low-energy cyclotrons. Our centre in Karaj employs a Cyclone-30 (IBA, Belgium). Solid targetry systems on these accelerators are made of pure copper backing onto which target materials are electrodeposited. It is noted that silver electrodeposits prepared from nitrate solutions, free of any organic or inorganic additive, are not smooth or compact, regardless of plating condition used. They consist of grains growing independently of each other and under given plating conditions may degenerate as dendrites.20 Since most of the work directed at replacing cyanide in silver plating 0236–5731/USD 20.00 © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest

Context:  Four symmetrical windows (22.36 or 11.69 cm2) on the vertical side wall allow up to four copper targets backing positioning. Each slot is sealed by an O-ring fitted window. The geometrical shape of the slot determines the actual target electrodeposition area. The liquid-tight sealing of the windows is realized by stainless steel mechanical pestles mounted on a PVC ring surrounding plating vessel and by pressing the copper backing against O-ring seal. An external PVC ring is fitted with four supporting pins to hold a motor-stirrer combination in position. The stirrer is a hollow perforated POM cylinder mounted on the axis of a DC motor and surrounding the platinum anode. The stirrer rotation speed is set at 600 rpm; during the process, its rotating direction is reversed after 8 seconds improving deposit homogeneity. To keep the desired temperature at a preset level, a heater (a series of six isolated 1 Ω/W resistors, through which an appropriate DC-current is forced (1.1 A, 40 °C up to 1.8 A, 60 °C) is circularly mounted at the bottom of the vessel. An insulated sensor, introduced through the stirrer support-plate, temperature. As monitors electrolysis to depletion requires long-time (up to 24 hours) plating, evaporation of plating solution occurs. To maintain a constant liquid volume (450 ml), a conductivity glass/graphite sensor monitors the solution level and actuates a peristaltic pump at the required rate, supplying distilled water to compensate evaporation losses. The rack-mounted home-made electronics includes a motor/stirrer control, an adjustable DC voltage generator card and four V/I converters coupled to current boosters.

Context: The morphology of all electrodeposited Ag target layers were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The evaluation of quality of the layers was achieved by comparison of the photomicrographs in terms of size and form of the Ag nuclei and the extent to which they overlapped each other. The smaller, more spherical and the more overlapping nuclei were considered to be a good plating quality. The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water. Observation of neither crack formation nor peeling off of the silver layers indicated a good adhesion for the purpose. SEM photomicrograph showed that the granulometry of electroplated targets with current density of 8.54–12.82 mA.cm–2 were not as desired (Figs 1a and 1b). Hence, current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2 was chosen and the SEM photomicrograph showed a suitable granulometry (Figs 2 and 3). The SEM photomicrograph of the best electrodeposition of these baths is shown in Fig. 3.

Context: where A0 and AF are the radioactivities of 99Mo in the initial mixed solution and supernatant after separating the precipitated ZSM gel, respectively, measured under identical geometric and counting conditions. Elution of 99mTc from 99Mo-99mTc chroma- tographic columns. Unless otherwise stated, small chromatographic columns consisting of glass burettes of different internal diameter and containing different amounts of zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo matrix were used. The columns were conditioned for 99mTc elution by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solutions through the bed matrix and left for 24 h before elution. The columns were eluted 10 times with different flow rates (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mL min–1) over the course of 15 days (shelf life). The time between each two successive elution runs was 23 h. The 99mTc elu- tion yield was determined by comparing the counting rates of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum of the column directly before and after elution, taking the contribution of 99Mo to this peak into account [15]. The elution profiles were drawn for various elution flow rates. pH values of the eluate solutions were de- termined with a pH meter.

For dry elution studies, a stream of air was passed through the molybdate bed to keep it free from the in- terstitial saline solution for the next elution. Preparation of 99mTc generator based on zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel matrix. A glass col- umn (1.1 cm i.d.) was packed with 6 g of the zirco- nium selenomolybdate-99Mo gel. The generator was conditioned for elution of 99mTc by passing 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution through the column bed and then left overnight to be ready for the elution of the gener- ated 99mTc radionuclide. The 99Mo content in the eluate (99Mo breakthrough) was determined, in the case of its presence, as the con- tribution of the count rate of 181 or 739 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum to the total count rate. The γ-ray spectrum of the eluate was measured directly after elu- tion and after 3 days. The radionuclidic purity of the eluted 99mTc was determined as the contribution of the count rate of the 140 keV peak in the γ-ray spectrum. The radiochemical purity defined as the percentage of 99mTc radioactivity present in the 99mTcO4 – form was determined by ascending paper chromatography using Whatman no. 1 chromatographic paper and 85% methanol as a developing solvent. The activity distri- bution along the chromatogram was determined with a γ-ray spectrometer, and Rf was calculated as the ratio of the distance (cm) traveled by 99mTc species from the starting line to the peak position to the distance (cm) traveled by the solvent from the starting line to the sol- vent front. The possible Zr, Mo, and Se impurities in 99mTc eluate were determined by ICP and/or UV-VIS spec- trometry. The zirconium selenomolybdate gel prepared under optimum conditions was characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TGA, DTA), XRD, XRF, and FESEM.

Context: gel matrix (ZSM-1) shows the presence of extra water molecules in addition to –OH groups and metal oxides present in the material (Fig. 1). The bands observed at 878 and 722 cm–1 may be due to metal–oxygen bonds, which are manifested in the range 650–1000 cm–1. The band at 1380 cm–1 belongs to bending vibrations of metal-bonded hydroxyl groups. The strong and sharp peak at 1617 cm–1 may be due to HOH bending vibra- tion. The absorption bands at 2900 and 3421 cm–1 may be assigned to stretching vibrations of coordinated wa- ter [30, 31]. Figure 2 shows the TG and DTA curves of the zir- conium selenomolybdate gel. The first step in the TG curve between 40–200°C with the weight loss of 11.58% corresponds to the loss of physically adsorbed water and water of crystallization with an endothermic peak in the DTA curve at 125°C. The weight loss in the range 200–440°C was small (2.6%). An endother- mic peak observed at 500.6°C with the weight loss of 11.165% in the range 435–530°C can be assigned to the evaporation of SeO2 and coordinated water and to decomposition of hydroxyl groups. The weight loss in the range 600–900°C was 4.51%. The presence of suit- able amounts of water in the gel material is important to enhance the 99mTc diffusion through the gel material during the elution [32]. Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dried zirconium selenomolybdate gel, which shows that it is amorphous. The amorphous structure is much better than the crystalline structure because of more efficient diffusion of the eluent through the amorphous material, increasing the elution yield. The SEM images of the prepared ZSM material at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the gel matrix has a porous basic structure, which makes it good material for diffusion of 99mTc during elution [33].

The broad and tailed elution profiles with increasing flow rate may be attributed to slow sorption/desorption kinetics of 99mTc. The elution yield was found to be 82.2, 81.7, and 78.3% at flow rates of 0.5, 1, and 2 mL min–1, respectively.

Context:  Cross section of the 186W(d, 2n)186Re reaction as a func- tion of deuteron energy: (1) this study, (2) data of [5], and (3) data of [6]. irradiated W powders, because a polymorphous transi- tion in W was discovered only in finely dispersed samples [17]). Heating of irradiated W above the polymorphous transition point (>1000 K) was accompanied by the release of 186Re into the gas phase; the release of the impurity atoms from the bulk of the metal became more active with an increase in the oxygen content in the medium in the course of heat treatment of the targets. In particular, when the irradiated cyclotron (cid:0)4 torr, the release of (cid:0)5(cid:0)10 targets were annealed at 10 (cid:0)2 torr it did not (cid:0)3(cid:0)10 186Re did not exceed 3%, at 10 exceed 15%, and when the samples (W/C composites) were heated in air, the release increased to 65% (typi- cal value for the majority of our experiments). This fact strongly suggests that, along with the emanation occurring at polymorphous transitions, there is some other process facilitating the release of radioactive microimpurities (in the form of volatile rhenium species ReO3, Re2O7) into the gas phase, e.g., their release in the course of cyclic gas transport reactions of the following type: oxidation of irradiated W metal with atmospheric oxygen (cid:7) sublimation of WO3 with the release of impurity 186Re atoms into the gas phase (cid:7) condensation of WO3 on graphite powder followed by its reduction to metal (cid:7) reoxidation of W metal, etc. We took this separation scheme as a basis for a (cid:3)dry(cid:4) process for 186Re production. Further experi- ments showed that the yield of the desired product can be increased to 85%, with its radiochemical purity being no worse than 99.99%.

Context: americium into an independent fraction with followed its transmutation in fast neutron reactors [1]. Previously, we proposed a method for separating the actinide–lanthanide fraction from a highly active raﬃ nate during the extraction with TBP in an isoparaﬃ n diluent in the presence of iron nitrate as a salting- out agent [2]. In this case, one of the most important radiochemical problems is the subsequent separation of americium from curium and lanthanides. This separation is necessary for a number of reasons. First, the lanthanides are neutron poisons; some isotopes have a high neutron capture cross section, and their presence in the fuel will inhibit the transmutation of americium [3, 4]. Secondly, the involvement of curium isotopes in a closed nuclear fuel cycle is problematic, since it has a high level of neutron and thermal radiation, which will complicate the manufacture and operation of regenerated homogeneous nuclear fuel or americium targets for its transmutation.

Context: The well-known problem of separating Am, Cm, and lanthanides is caused by the similarity in their chemical properties [5, 6]. TPE and lanthanides are 5f- and 4f-elements, respectively, they are characterized by the ﬁ lling of internal f-orbitals with increasing atomic number, which has little eﬀ ect on the chemical properties that depend mainly on processes in the outer electron shells. In view of this fact, these elements predominantly exist in aqueous solutions in the oxidation state(III). The ionic radii of these cations are also comparable. Americium and curium ions have isostructural analogs in the lanthanide series: r(Nd3+) ≈ r(Am3+), r(Sm3+) ≈ r(Cm3+). Thus, it is diﬃ cult to separate trivalent Am and Cm from lanthanides by adjusting only the size of the coordination sphere of organic ligands. There are several approaches to the separation of Am from Cm and lanthanides, and most of them are based on extraction methods [7, 8]. The key diﬀ erence between these cations is that americium can be oxidized to higher oxidation states Am(V,VI), which changes its extraction behavior [9, 10]. Previously, in our works [11, 12], it was shown that, generating Am(VI) in weakly acidic solutions makes it possible to extract Cm(III) from their mixture using the extractants 1-phenyl-3-methyl- 4-benzoylpyrosolone-5 and trioctylphosphine oxide, while Am(VI), being reduced by the organic phase to Am(V), remains in the aqueous solution. At the same time, the use of these extractants in industrial conditions is challenging. For this reason, it was proposed [13] to use TBP as a reliable and well-tested extractant in the technology to solve the problem of separating Am from Cm. For example, curium was extracted almost quantitatively from solutions containing ≤0.1 M HNO3 and ~8 M NH4NO3 using 30% TBP in Isopar-M, while americium was only partially (≤30%) transferred to the organic phase in the Am(III) form. In this case, a high degree of separation of Cm from Am(V) remaining in the aqueous phase was attained (≥99.9%). At the moment, only a few other works [14–16] are known on the use of TBP as an extractant for separating Am from other transuranium elements or lanthanides. For example, in [14, 16], it was proposed to extract Am(VI) directly from nitric acid solutions without adding a salting-out agent. Reaching high distribution coeﬃ cients can be performed by adjusting the solution acidity. At the initial stage, a decrease in acidity is provided for the eﬃ cient oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI), then its increase it to 1 M relative to HNO3. The separation factor for the Am–Nd pair was about 50; therewith separation of the Am–Np pair did not occur. In [15], it was proposed to use dihydrogen phosphate to bind Nd into a more stable complex compared to Am(VI), which allowed to reach a separation factor of about 120. This work is aimed at studying the extraction of Am in higher oxidation states in weakly acidic solutions— simulants of the actinide–lanthanide fraction of a highly active raﬃ nate, containing americium and curium isotopes and weight amounts of lanthanides (with praseodymium as an example)—using TBP and in the presence of ammonium nitrate as a salting-out agent, not forming insoluble salts with actinides and ﬁ ssion products, including lanthanides.

Context: Figure 1 shows the spectrum (1) of an initial 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing trivalent Am, Cm, and Pr with the concentrations given in Table 1 as well as spectrum (2) of the same solution after the quantitative oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) according to the procedure described in the experimental part. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the presence in the solution of an almost 100-fold excess of Pr compared to Am (10.5 and 0.13 g/L, respectively) does not aﬀ ect the Am(III) oxidation. We preliminarily studied the extraction of Am(VI) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the pres- ence of 8 M NH4NO3 with 30% TBP in Isopar-M (Table 1). It can be seen from the data in Table 1 that both trivalent Cm and Pr and Am(VI) are extracted to a high degree (up to 95 wt %) under the conditions of the study. The distribution coeﬃ cients (D) of Am(VI), Cm(III), and Pr(III) per an extraction were about 2.5, 3.6, and 1.8, respectively. DAm(VI) = 2.5 correlates with the data of [21], where the maximum distribution co- eﬃ cient was achieved at 4 M HNO3 and the minimum phase contact time, and, however, it was slightly lower than in [16], where 100% TBP was used for extraction. Spectrophotometric method was applied to prove that agent by heating the solution at 90°C for 20 min according to the procedure described in [11]. The eﬃ ciency of this method is usually limited by nitric acid concentrations of no more than 0.5 M [18]. At higher acid concentrations, ammonium persulfate decomposes to form hydrogen peroxide, an eﬀ ective reducing agent 2+ [19]. However, this eﬀ ect, apparently, can be for AmO2 leveled by increasing the concentration of the oxidizing agent to 1.6 M [14], which enabled oxidation of Am(III) to Am(VI) in 1 M HNO3 by 90 ± 5%. A solution containing Am(V) was obtained by adding 1 μL of a 37% H2O2 solution to 1 mL of an Am(VI) solution in 0.1 M HNO3 previously prepared as described above. The authors of [20] report the possibility of direct preparation of Am(V) in 0.1 M HNO3 by heating to 80–100°C and an ammonium persulfate concentration of 1 M. The completeness of Am(III) oxidation to Am(VI) and its subsequent reduction to Am(V), their behavior during extraction, as well as the concentration of Pr(III) in the solution were monitored by a spectrophotometric method (Unicam UV-300, Unicam Instruments, UK) according to absorption bands at 503 and 814 nm for Am(III), 513 and 717 nm for Am(V), 666 and 996 nm for Am(VI), and 445 and 592 nm for Pr. In extraction experiments, a 30% TBP solution in Isopar-M was used, which was preliminarily contacted for 5 min with an equal volume of a 0.1 M HNO3 solution containing 0.2 M (NH4)2S2O8. Before extraction, a weighed portion of NH4NO3 was introduced into the resulting solutions containing Am(VI) or Am(V), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, to achieve its concentration in the solution of 8 M, as in [13]. Extraction of actinides and Pr was carried out for 1 min at a ratio of aqueous (A) and organic (O) phases of 1 : 5. As we determined earlier [13], 1 min is enough to set thermodynamic equilibrium at the distribution of Am(III) and Cm between a nitric acid solution containing NH- 4NO3 as a salting-out agent and 30% TBP in isopar-M. The phases were brought into contact with each other by shaking the tubes by hand for 1 min. The phases were then centrifuged to separate them for about 1 min at 2000 rpm. After the phases were separated and analyzed. The total concentration of Am and Cm in the used solutions was found by alpha spectrometry (Alpha Analyst, Canberra, USA).

Context:  Fig. 2. Absorption spectra of Am(V) and Pr(III) in 0.1 M HNO3 before (1) and after (2) adding salting-out agent (8 M NH4NO3). The main problem of using Am(V) for its separation from Cm and REE is its reduction to Am(III), which is well extractable under these conditions. The Am(V) reduction occurs under the action of radiolysis products [22], disproportionation of Am(V) [23], and due to contact with organic phase. Selection of the conditions under which the extraction of Am(V) in TBP will be minimal without replacing TBP with the TODGA extractant, which is not yet available for industrial technology, as was done in [24, 25], will make it possible to achieve the quantitative separation of americium from curium, as well from lanthanides. Thus, an important task for future research is the stabilization of americium in its weakly extractable form Am(V).

Context: 1. OECD-NEA Potential Beneﬁ ts and Impacts of Advanced Nuclear Fuel Cycles with Actinide Partitioning and Transmutation; Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), Paris: OECD, 2011. The extraction of Am(V) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of 8 M NH4NO3 with 30% TBP in Isopar-M was studied. It was preliminarily conﬁ rmed that the addition of the salting-out agent NH4NO3 to the solution does not lead to a change in the oxidation state of Am(V) (Fig. 2). Experiments were conducted in which the Pr content was 1.05 or 10.5 g/L at a constant content of Am(V) and Cm; extraction was performed at a ratio of A : O = 1 : 5. Data of Table 2 show that diﬀ erent Pr content does not lead to a change in the degree of extraction of Am(V) in a one-stage extraction. The distribution coeﬃ cient of Am(V) is found to be about 0.1; americium is extracted in organic phase by no more than 30% of its content in the initial solution, which is consistent with the data of [13]. At the same time, the distribution coeﬃ cients of Pr and Cm are found to be very close, about 1 (Table 2), and the degree of their extraction is 80–85% per extraction cycle. It was noted that the separation factor SFCm/Am is found to be signiﬁ cantly lower than in [13], when it was possible to extract Cm almost completely in organic phase (SFCm/Am was 65). Obviously, this can be explained by the eﬀ ect of more than a hundredfold amount of Pr present in the solution relative to the initial Am content. It should also be taken into account that the concentrations of Am and Cm in the initial solution were several orders of magnitude higher (0.13 and 1.38 × 10–4, respectively) than in [13]. At the same time, it was shown that the separation fac- tor can be increased by using a three-stage extraction at a volume ratio of A : O = 1 : 1, as it was demonstrated for Pr in the absence of TPE (Table 3). In this case, the degree of its extraction reached 98%, even though the total volume of the extractant was 1.6 times less than in the case of one-stage extraction with the ratio A : O = 1 : 5.

Context: The isotope 90Sr, formed during the ﬁ ssion of uranium and plutonium nuclei, together with 137Cs makes the main contribution to the global pollution of water and soil on Earth. Atmospheric nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility of 90Sr brings about its distribution in the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of living beings, where it concentrates in the bones and damages the surrounding tissues. The obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment is complicated by its nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the matrix material, exposure until equilibrium with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid– liquid extraction is widely used for the separation of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is eﬃ ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2]. But in both cases, a preliminary acid digesting of the samples is necessary, which involves the use of toxic and aggressive reagents. We proposed

As can be seen from the data in Fig. 6, in all the systems studied, there is a high percentage of yttrium extraction (70–80%), therewith aqueous phases consisting of ammonium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate with the addition of hydrogen peroxide proved to be more eﬀ ective. The introduction of hydrogen peroxide into the leaching solution was proposed for further oxidizing possible organic residues. Table 1 presents data on carbonate penetration and separation of yttrium from a soil sample containing the 90Y/90Sr radioactive label and stable yttrium with strontium. Based on the measurement results, the percentage of 90Y extraction from the soil was calculated (ﬁ nal value after all operations). The data obtained show that leaching from a soil sample is less eﬃ cient than from pure sand, which may be due to the high content of mineral acid salts in the soil, which pass into the aqueous phase during leaching and interfere with the complete extraction of yttrium, as well to the possibility of mechanical retention of yttrium by microdispersed particles.

Context: Abstract—Various methods have been developed for the extraction of a promising medical radionuclide 117mSn from proton-irradiated TiSb intermetallic compound, a target material suitable for irradiation with an intense beam of accelerated protons. To separate radiotin from Ti, Sb, and radionuclides of other elements, methods of ion- exchange chromatography and liquid extraction were used, in particular, the anion-exchange separation of tin and titanium in the form of a peroxide complex in HCl solution, extraction of tin with benzene from iodide solutions, and chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from citrate solutions. As a result, 117mSn of high purity, which meets the requirements for nuclear medicine, was obtained. Keywords: 117mSn, TiSb intermetallic compound, proton irradiation, separation of radiotin and titanium, ion exchange, extraction. DOI: 10.1134/S1066362221060114 In recent decades, the therapy of oncological and other human diseases with the use of radiopharmaceuticals (RP) has developed signiﬁ cantly. More than 80% of cancer patients suﬀ er from bone metastases [1]. Interstitial radionuclide therapy using RP based on radionuclides releasing electrons is one of the eﬀ ective methods of treating patients with widespread bone metastases. RP based on the 117mSn radionuclide (in particular, 117mSn4+DTPA) [2–5] have a number of advantages over other drugs. The decay of the metastable radionuclide 117mSn is accompanied by the release of monoenergetic conversion electrons (127, 129, and 152 keV) with a short and discrete range of 0.2–0.3 mm in biological tissue. Soft radiation leads to a local eﬀ ect on tumor cells without damaging healthy tissues. The γ-radiation (159 keV) during the decay of 117mSn may be used to control the therapeutic eﬀ ect (theranostics). Clinical trials of drugs 117mSn4+DTPA for the relief of bone pain, 117mSn4+DOTA-annexin for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and the 117mSn colloid for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are being successfully carried out [1, 6]. Until recently, 117mSn was produced mainly from the reactions of stable tin isotopes, 116Sn(n,γ)117mSn or 117Sn(n,n’γ)117mSn, with neutrons. In this case, the speciﬁ c activity of 117mSn did not exceed 740 GBq/g (20 Ci/g) [2, 7]. The presence of stable tin seriously limits the possibilities of medical application of the reactor-produced 117mSn. A product with a high speciﬁ c activity can be obtained via reactions with accelerated charged particles, of which two approaches are the most promising and demonstrate comparable production rates of 117mSn: nat,121,123Sb(p,x)117mSn [8, 9] and 116Cd(α,3n)117mSn [10,11]. Nowadays, powerful and compact cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type, developed and manufactured by the IBA Company (Belgium), are becoming more widespread, capable of accelerating proton beams with an intensity of more than 300 μA to an energy of 70 MeV. Such cyclotrons are successfully applied for large-scale production of radioisotopes, mainly for medical purposes [12, 13]. On the basis of experimentally determined cross sections, it was shown [14] that the 117mSn radionuclide can be produced by proton irradiation of an antimony target with an initial energy of 145 MeV and below. Irradiation of natural antimony or antimony enriched with 123Sb with the proton energy 55 or 70 MeV, respectively, leads to the formation of 117mSn, which contains a trace amount of the undesirable long-lived radioisotope 113Sn. The presence of another long-lived radioisotope 119mSn (Т1/2 = 293 days), as impurity, which releases soft

Context: gamma radiation during decay into stable 119Sn, does not interfere with medical use of 117mSn. Therefore, the implementation of the nat,123Sb(p,x)117mSn approach on cyclotrons of the Cyclone 70-type for producing large amounts of 117mSn of medical quality seems especially promising. In [15], we proposed a method for obtaining no-carrier-added 117mSn from a thick target of metallic antimony irradiated with protons. After dissolution of the antimony target, the radiotin was isolated by liquid- liquid extraction (LLE) with dibutyl ether, followed by exhaustive puriﬁ cation on silica gel. The method provides production of up to 3 Ci (100 GBq) 117mSn of high radionuclidic purity with a speciﬁ c activity of about 1000 Ci/g (more than 40 GBq/mg). However, since metallic antimony has low thermal conductivity, low melting point and high vapor pressure, antimony targets cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high-intensity proton currents. In addition, antimony actively interacts with many materials that are usually used for the manufacture of the target shell, which leads to its radiation damage. Instead of metallic antimony, intermetallic compounds, such as TiSb, NiSb, and AlSb, were considered as a target material, of which TiSb turned out to be the most promising [16]. The TiSb properties, unique in many respects, have been studied since the 1950s [17]. The compound combines high stability (the enthalpy of formation is estimated as –167 kJ/mol [18]), and a high melting point of 1160°C with pronounced metallic properties, including high electrical and thermal conductivity. According to our estimate, the value of the latter is twice the thermal conductivity of titanium and antimony taken separately. In the chemical separation of 117mSn from irradiated TiSb, it is necessary to remove not only macro-quantites of antimony, but also macroquantites of titanium. Previously, removal of antimony was studied in [15]. Removal of titanium is diﬃ cult due to the similarity of its chemical behavior with that of tin; in the few studies described in the literature, extraction and chromatographic separation methods are used. Sn(IV) can be extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone from 7 M HCl solutions, while Ti(IV) remains in the aqueous phase [19]. Then, the tin is reextracted with dilute solutions of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid [20]. In analytical practice, tin is also extracted with benzene from HI solutions. The extraction of tin with

Context: benzene proceeds most eﬃ ciently at a perchloric acid content of 4.66 M, sulfuric acid content of 1 M (total acidity 6.6 M), and a potassium iodide content of 0.5 M. In this case, titanium and antimony, as well as I–III metals, including indium and scandium, are not extracted [21]. Tin is reextracted with a 1–2 M HCl solution. However, this technique was developed only for the analytical determination of milligram amounts of tin [22]; its applicability for isolation of no-carrier- added radiotin has not been studied. Chromatographic separation of Ti(IV) from ions of other metals is possible by sorption of titanium in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on a weakly basic anion exchanger Amberlite CG-4B [23]. A similar behavior of Ti(IV) is observed on AG 50W-X8 and Dowex 50W cation exchangers in 0.05 M H2SO4 solutions with the addition of 1% H2O2 [24]. Ti(IV) is not adsorbed on strongly basic anion-exchange resins (Dowex 1×8 and AG 1 × 8) [25]. As known, Ti forms peroxide complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+, positively charged and stable in strongly acidic solutions. At the same time, Sn forms the anionic complex [SnCl6]2– in strong hydrochloric acid solutions; therefore, the separation of oppositely charged Sn and Ti complexes can be carried out both on cation-exchange and anion-exchange resins. For example, when a hydrochloric acid solution of Sn and Ti containing a minor excess of H2O2, is passed through an anion-exchange resin, [SnCl6]2– anions are adsorbed, whereas [TiO(H2O2)] cations pass through the column. Then, tin is desorbed by passing through the column solutions that decompose the [SnCl6]2– anionic complex. For separating trace amounts of tin from macroquantites of titanium, this method is preferable, since it does not require large volumes of sorbent. Basically, the methods presented in the literature have been developed for the separation of macroquantities of Sn, Sb, and Ti, while the behavior of radionuclides in the “no-carrier-added” state can diﬀ er signiﬁ cantly. When producing 117mSn of high speciﬁ c activity, it is necessary to separate the macroquantites of Sb and Ti from the ul- tramicroquantities of Sn. In addition, proton irradiation of antimony and titanium produces other radionuclides, capable of aﬀ ecting purity of the target product, and they must also be separated from tin. In this study, we propose options for the extraction of 117mSn with a high speciﬁ c activity from the proton-irradiated antimony– titanium intermetallic compound to prepare RP.

Context: of positively charged complexes [TiO(H2O2)]2+. These complexes are stable in acidic media, including HCl, in which tin forms the anionic complexes [SnCl6]2–. Our preliminary experiments showed that Ti macroquantities are not sorbed from 2 M HCl and are not completely sorbed from 1 M HCl. The ion-exchange separation of radiotin from titanium was carried out from 0.5 M HCl, while the titanium concentration was reduced by a factor of 20. However, this method is not entirely suitable for solving our problem, since large volumes of sorbent are required to remove macroamounts of titanium, which should be disposed and lead to the loss of radiotin. The separation of radiotin from titanium on strongly basic anion exchangers turned out to be more promising approach. The above possibility was studied on model solutions. The chromatographic procedure consisted of passing a hydrochloric acid solution of radiotin and titanium, containing a small stoichiometric excess of H2O2, through an anion exchange resin. In this case, [SnCl6]2– anions were sorbed on the column, while [TiO(H2O2)]2+ cations passed through the column. The column was washed with 6 M HCl to remove titanium. The titanium concentration in the washing solution and, as a consequence, in the target product depended on the degree of puriﬁ cation of the initial solution from macroamounts of antimony (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that an increase in the antimony concentration has adverse eﬀ ect on the puriﬁ cation from titanium. Next, we compared the eﬃ ciency of puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, tellurium, and antimony residues on two strongly basic anion exchangers: Dowex 1 × 8 and AG 1 × 8. Both resins, similar in composition but diﬀ ering in brands, have approximately the same eﬀ ect in relation to tin, tellurium, and antimony radionuclides. At the same time, they diﬀ er in relation to titanium (Fig. 2). Figure 2 shows that titanium is more easily washed out of a

Sorbent AG 1 × 8, column 0.6 cm in diameter and 6 cm in height, ﬂ ow rate 0.8 mL/min. Antimony concentration, g/L: (1) (2–5) 10–3, (2) 3.6, and (3) 14.4. column ﬁ lled with AG 1 × 8, especially in the presence of macroamounts of antimony. Therefore, further experiments were performed with AG 1 × 8 resin. After washing, part of tellurium remains on the column, in addition to radiotin. Radiotin was eluted with a nitric acid solution, which decomposes the anionic complex. Table 3 shows the dependence of the amount of radiotin remaining in the adsorbed state on the nitric acid concentration. With an increase in the HNO3 concentration, the yield of radiotin increases, while tellurium radionuclides start to desorb simultaneously. Optimal for elution is 2 M HNO3. In this case, a radiotin yield of about 90% is achieved, and the content of tellurium radionuclides is reduced by about 2-fold. Heating nitric acid to 40°C increases the radiotin yield up to 98%. A high content of antimony in the initial solution not only has adverse eﬀ ect on the removal of titanium, but also decreases the yield of radiotin, which can be seen from the integral curves of 113Sn elution at various concentrations of antimony in the initial solutions (Fig. 3). Increasing the antimony concentration in the solution to 3.6 g/L reduces the radiotin yield to 90%. Thus, the presence of antimony with a concentration on the order of 1 g/L will be quite acceptable for eﬃ cient separation of 117mSn and titanium at this stage. Change in the chromatographic behavior can be followed in Fig.4, demonstrating curves of elution of antimony from the column upon washing with a 6 M HCl and desorption of radiotin in a 2 M HNO3 on the antimony concentration in the initial solution. As seen, with an increase in the concentration of antimony in the initial solution, it is less retained by the sorbent upon passage of 6 M HCl and is desorbed with 2 M HNO3 by a broader peak. Based on the above dependences, the following optimal parameters of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and titanium were determined:

Context: Fig. 9. Chromatographic isolation of titanium during the separation of radiotin from an irradiated TiSb target. Sorbent AG 1×8. Column 0.8 cm in diameter and 8 cm in height, ﬂ ow rate 0.8 mL/min. a concentrated HNO3 was added dropwise on heating. Violent dissolution and formation of a white suspension was observed. After 4 h, dissolution was complete. After cooling the thus obtained solution (no. 2), the precipitate was ﬁ ltered oﬀ. To the solution (no. 1) a ﬁ ltered solution (no. 2) was added. This method was used to dissolve an experimental TiSb sample irradiated in an accelerator. It was shown that radiotin is not adsorbed on the formed sediment at the acidity above 3 M HCl. The composite solution was transferred into a 10 M HCl solution, and macroquantites of antimony were removed by extraction with dibutyl ether. Since model experiments demonstrated the possibility of puriﬁ cation from titanium macroquantities both by extraction and by chromatography, the solution obtained after removing antimony was divided into two portions to test both methods. The ﬁ rst portion was puriﬁ ed from titanium on a chromatographic column, and the second portion, by extraction with benzene from iodide solutions. For chromatographic puriﬁ cation on an AG 1 × 8 column, the solution was diluted to 6 M HCl. Results of the anion-exchange separation of radiotin and Ti are demonstrated in Fig. 9. Passing the initial solution and subsequent washing the column with a 6 M HCl caused titanium to wash out of the column in the form of a positively charged complex [TiO(H2O2)]2+ and as trivalent cations of indium and scandium radioisotopes, while radiotin and antimony in the form of anionic complexes [SbCl6]– and [SnCl6]2– retained by the sorbent together with tellurium radioisotopes.

Context: Ti, 114mln, 46Sc tellurium occurs. For the ﬁ nal puriﬁ cation of the radiotin, chromatographic separation on silica gel was carried out as described above. As a result, the total yield of 117mSn was 75–82%, the puriﬁ cation factors for Sb and Ti were about 106, and the radionuclidic purity of 117mSn was no less than 99.9% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated). Second portion of the solution prepared by dissolving TiSb was transferred into a solution containing 4.66 M HClO4, 1 M H2SO4, and 1 M KI, and the radiotin was extracted twice with benzene. Then, radiotin was reextracted from benzene with 1.5 M HCl. Like chromatography, this method provided puriﬁ cation of radiotin from titanium, indium, and scandium radionuclides. Trace amounts of antimony and tellurium impurities (Table 4) remained after the extraction were removed by further adsorption on silica gel from citrate solutions. In the given case, the total yield of 117mSn was 80– 85%, the puriﬁ cation factor for Sb and Ti, about 106, and the radionuclidic purity was no less than 99.7% (excluding the 113Sn isotopic impurity, which is not chemically separated).

Context: To conclude, the processes of separation of no-carrier- added 117mSn from the TiSb intermetallic compound irradiated with protons have been investigated. The dissolution of TiSb in the HCl and HNO3 acids with the addition of HNO3 and H2O2 has been studied. It was shown that the presence of titanium in the resulting solutions does not impede the eﬀ ective extraction of most of the antimony with dibutyl ether. For further separation of radiotin from macroquantities of titanium, both chromatography and extraction can be used. Using the chromatography method, we studied the possibility of separating radiotin in the form of [SnCl6]2– from titanium in the form of an oppositely charged complex [TiO (H2O2)]2+ on strong AG 1 × 8 and

Context:  Dowex 1 × 8 anion exchangers from a 6 M HCl solution in the presence of H2O2. It was shown that AG-1 × 8 provides higher puriﬁ cation eﬃ ciency. In the extraction separation of radiotin and titanium, the best results were achieved for the extraction of radiotin with benzene from a solution containing a mixture of perchloric and sulfuric acids and iodide ions with a concentration of 0.5–1 M. Each of the methods used has its own advantages and disadvantages [30]. In our case, the advantage of extraction in comparison with chromatography is the short time of the process, and the disadvantage is a slightly lower yield of radiotin and worsening of its puriﬁ cation from titanium at a residual concentration of antimony in the initial solution above 0.1 g/L. In our opinion, the method of titanium separation on the AG 1 × 8 anion exchanger is most preferable, since it, although being more time-consuming, is less sensi- tive to the antimony content in the initial solution (about 1 g/L), and is also easier-to-implement in hot chambers. In both methods, the separation of radiotin was terminated by chromatographic puriﬁ cation on silica gel from a solution containing 0.5 M sodium citrate at pH 5.5. As a result, the 117mSn product with high radionuclidic purity and high speciﬁ c activity was obtained in at least 75-% yield, which is promising for the development of production technology of 117mSn in large quantities in the future.

Context: Irrespective of the procedure of radionuclide ac- cumulation, 67Cu can be isolated by vacuum distilla- tion separation of the irradiated zinc targets performed at temperature and pressure providing their complete removal and excluding evaporation of the desired product. This procedure is based on the difference of the evaporation rates and partial vapor pressures of the elements being separated over the solid phase [13]. This method requires changes in the common design of the cyclotron targets (copper or silver sup- ports with deposited isotope material; their modifica- tion should exclude physicochemical interaction (dif- fusion, alloying) of the material being activated and final radionuclides with the support material at elevated temperatures. One of possible solutions is preparation of the targets from inert high-melting materials. Special cyclotron supports were developed for ir- radiation of zinc targets in derived beams of domestic reactors (e.g., U-120 reactor of the St. Petersburg University). In this target, the material to be activated is deposited on a thin (750 (cid:5)m) tantalum support (24 mm in diameter); the (cid:6)loss(cid:7) in the thermal con- ductivity of tantalum as compared to silver and zinc is compensated by optimal combination of the strength and mechanical properties. Zinc metal is deposited by fusion in an inert atmosphere in a special cavity (14 mm in diameter) in the support center. In the course of irradiation, the excess heat is removed from

Context:  Using the procedure for longitudinal flow along an impermeable plate [17, 18], we determined the coeffi- cients of heat transfer of tantalum in water of 98 000 (cid:0) 67 200 W m(cid:2)2 K(cid:2)1, decreasing in the direction from the center. Taking into account these coefficients, we found that the maximal temperature in the irradiated layer of elemental tellurium is lower than 545.6 K (272.6(cid:8)C). Thus, our calculations showed the principal suit- ability of the target of elemental tellurium deposited on a tantalum support; the most dangerous cross sec- tion of the support operates under the compression conditions, which allows the beam current to be in- creased to 20 (cid:5)A. To decrease the deflection of the tantalum support (i.e., to eliminate the possibility of exfoliation of elemental tellurium), its thickness can be increased to 1(cid:0)1.5 mm.

Also, a two-stage sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair without using the extraction method was developed. At the ﬁ rst stage the 90Y was separated from 90Sr with Purolite D5041 phosphate cation exchange resin, and at the second stage, 90Y deep puriﬁ cation was carried out on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent.

Context: Radionuclide 90Y is one of the ﬁ rst radioactive isotopes to be used for radiotherapy and the interest in 90Y continues although more than 30 radionuclides are currently used for this purpose. This interest is due to its convenient nuclear-physical properties: a half-life of 64.2 h and a maximum β-energy of 2.27 MeV. 90Y is used for a variety of therapeutic purposes including radioimmunotherapy with labeled antibodies, treatment of liver tumors and rheumatoid arthritis [1]. 90Y is formed during the decay of the long-lived radioisotope 90Sr, which is a ﬁ ssion product of uranium. One of the important requirements for the safe clinical use of 90Y is deep puriﬁ cation from 90Sr, which has a high aﬃ nity for bone tissue and can cause bone marrow damage. The regulated 90Sr content in the 90Y radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine for therapeutic procedures should not exceed 2 × 10–6 Ci/Ci of 90Y. In addition, there are strict requirements for the heavy metal content, which in a 90Y radiopharmaceutical in total should not exceed 10 μg per 1 Ci of 90Y [2, 3]. In order to produce the ﬁ nal product with the required purity, an 90Y multistage puriﬁ cation from chemical and radiochemical impurities is carried out, mainly by liquid extraction and ion exchange methods [1]. Each of these methods has its own limitations and disadvantages. Thus, ion-exchange methods for producing 90Y are quite simple to implement, however, the long duration of sorption processes (18–20 h) leads to signiﬁ cant losses of the ﬁ nished product due to its decomposition. In practice, isotope generators are often used. Their action is based on the sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair on a sulfonic cation exchange resin, for example, Dowex 50W×8. In this case, the 90Y yield is 90–98%, but the 90Sr impurity gradually increases due to the radiation destruction of the resin. Moreover, additional operations of chemical treatment of eluates are required to convert 90Y into a form suitable for further use (0.01 mol/dm3 HCl solution). The method of liquid extraction employing di- 2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid (D2EHPA) is currently considered the most eﬀ ective method for separating an equilibrium 90Y/90Sr mixture. The extraction proceeds rather quickly: the total time of the 90Y extraction process is 30–60 min, the yield of the target product is more than 95%, and the 90Sr content in the ﬁ nished product is less than 10–6%. However, the obtained 90Y contains, in addition to residual amounts of 90Sr, impurities of corrosion products (Fe, Ni, Cr, Pb, etc.)

Context: divinylbenzene copolymer was used as a carrier. The TODGA content in the sorbent was 40 wt %, the granule size was 0.315–0.50 mm. For puriﬁ cation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column lled with AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent, the volume ﬁ of the sorbent in the column was 4 cm3. Before the experiments, the sorbent was treated in a column with a 5 M nitric acid solution for 2 h. At the sorption stage the initial solution was passed through the column at a rate of 6.0 column volumes per an hour [(c.v.)/h]. The ﬁ ltrate at the column outlet was collected and tested for the amounts of chemical impurities. After the end of the sorption, a 3 M HCl solution was passed through the column at a rate of 3.0 c.v./h to remove the initial solution residues. Desorption of 90Y was performed with 0.01 M HCl. The passing rate was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. The supply of the solutions during pre-treatment and at all stages was carried out using a peristaltic pump from bottom to top. The total time of sorption puriﬁ cation was 5–6 h. Sorption separation of the 90Sr/90Y pair. The 90Sr/90Y pair separation experiments were carried out employing a model solution containing 1.5 g/dm3 strontium and 0.15 mg/dm3 yttrium nitrates and 0.01– 0.3 M nitric acid therewith a label of the equilibrium 90Sr/90Y pair was introduced into the model solution in an amount of about 105 Bq/dm3. At the ﬁ rst stage of separation, the initial solution was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 D5041 phosphate cation exchange resin (Purolite, Great Britain). Then the sorbent was washed with a 0.01–0.3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 3 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined. At the second stage of separation, hydrochloric acid desorbate was passed through a plastic column ﬁ lled with 4.5 cm3 AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent. Then the sorbent was washed with a 3 M HCl solution and 90Y was stripped with a 0.01 M HCl solution. The ﬂ ow rate of the solutions was 3.0 c.v./h, the solution volume was 6 c.v. In the ﬁ ltrate and desorbate, the speciﬁ c total beta activity was determined for at least 35 days. The setup scheme is shown in Fig. 1.

Context: The above is conﬁ rmed by the time dependences of the relative beta activity of hydrochloric acid desorbates (3 M) obtained after sorption with a D5041 cation exchange resin from solutions with diﬀ erent HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 2b). Figures 2b shows, for clarity, the calculated decay curve of pure radionuclide 90Y calculated according to the radioactive decay law. The results on Fig. 2b show that hydrochloric acid desorbates obtained after the 90Sr/90Y pair sorption by the D5041 cation exchange resin from 0.2–0.3 M HNO3 solutions and washing with HCl solutions of the same concentrations contain almost pure 90Y. The residual activity of desorbates after keeping for 45 days does not exceed 0.1% of the initial activity of the solution, and the experimental and calculated decomposition curves of desorbates almost completely coincide. Due to the fact that even deeper puriﬁ cation of 90Y from 90Sr is required for use in the production of radiopharmaceuticals, the obtained hydrochloric acid desorbates were subjected to additional puriﬁ cation with the TODGA-containing sorbent AXIONIT MND 40T. Sorbents of this type are capable of eﬃ cient sorption of REE and Y in strongly acidic media including hydrochloric acid. In acid solutions with a concentration of less than 0.1 M the sorption of REE(Y) sharply decreases, which makes it possible to carry out their desorption.

Context: solutions with a concentration above 3 M the complete yttrium extraction occurs, while the sorption of strontium and corrosion products on this sorbent practically does not occur. This allows at the sorption stage to carry out deep puriﬁ cation of 90Y from 90Sr and a wide range of chemical impurities (chromium, manganese, nickel, lead, iron, zirconium). The unique sorption properties of the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent make it possible to aﬀ ord pure 90Y radiopharmaceuticals without employing the extraction method that is complex in hardware implementation. At the ﬁ rst stage of the process, selective sorption of 90Y from weakly acidic media is carried out on a phosphate cation exchange resin, where the main part of 90Sr is separated and passed into the ﬁ ltrate. Desorption of 90Y from the phosphate cation exchange resin with 3 M HCl and then 90Y sorption from the hydrochloric acid desorbate on the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent allow deep puriﬁ cation both from residual amounts of 90Sr and from chemical impurities of corrosion products. Elution of 90Y from the AXIONIT MND 40T sorbent is easily carried out with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, which is the preferred medium for obtaining 90Y-based radiopharmaceuticals.

Context: Abstract—Recovery of lutetium and ytterbium with solutions of 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester in isopar-M and m-nitrobenzotriﬂ uoride (F3), as well as with solutions of bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid in isopar M was investigated. Using the equilibrium shift method, it was shown that ytterbium and lutetium are recovered by the cation exchange mechanism in the form of the Ln[HA2]3 adduct up to 3 M HNO3, and with a further increase in the concentration of nitric acid in an aqueous solution, the separation mechanism changes to a solvate one. The separation factors β(Lu/Yb) in the studied separation systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained data can be used for subsequent calculations of the extraction cascade for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium. Mathematical processing of experimental data was carried out to derive separation constants.

(Point) experiment, (line) calculation. acid molecule. Most authors believe that the extractant is present in the organic phase as a dimer (HA)2 [15], since the dimerization constants of P507 and Cyanex-272 are very high (log K = 20 and 4.2, respectively [16]). In the separation of rare earth elements with P507 solutions in the range of HNO3 concentrations not higher than 4 M, a linear relationship between the logarithms of Yb and Lu distribution coeﬃ cients and the logarithm of the HNO3 concentration is observed with a slope close to –3 (Fig. 1), which allows the reaction equation to be applied: The deviation from the linearity (Fig. 1) at a concentration of 4 M HNO3 and higher may be due to the transition to extraction by the solvate (donor- acceptor) mechanism, which occurs, for example, in the extraction of REE with HDEHP solutions from acidic media [17, 18]. It is assumed that from 1 to 3 extractant molecules take part in the formation of the solvate [19], however, in view of the insigniﬁ cance of this reaction contribution to the overall extraction mechanism and the lack of data at higher HNO3 concentrations, the value of m was taken equal to 1, as in [4].

Context: Figure 5 shows the linear relationship between the logarithms of the equilibrium constants (2) and (5) and the logarithm of the relative Р507 concentration. The values of the slope coeﬃ cients a and the values of the parameters log K0 calculated by the least squares method are presented in Table 2. Unfortunately, the derived log K0 values were found to be diﬀ erent for these two diluents, which did not allow reducing the number of parameters used. The almost parallel behavior of the curves of the REE distribution coeﬃ cients vs. the P507 concentration and the HNO3 concentration indicates that the separation factors of Yb and Lu will slightly rise with a decrease in the extractant concentration remaining in the range of 1.4–1.6 (the separation factors were derived as the ratio of the experimentally found distribution coeﬃ cients from solutions containing Yb and Lu in diﬀ erent proportions). With an increase in the HNO3 concentration in an aqueous solution, the solvate mechanism of REE extraction begins to play an increasingly important role resulting in a decrease in separation factors.

Context: With increasing the acid concentration in the aqueous phase above 3 M, the REE extraction brings about an increase in the distribution coeﬃ cients, which can be due to a gradual transition to the solvate mechanism of extraction. At the same time, with an increase in the concentration of Cyanex-272, the slope of the ascending section of the function of the distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the HNO3 concentration diminishes (Fig. 6), which can be described by Eqs.

Context: The slope of the function of REE distribution coeﬃ cient vs. the Cyanex-272 concentration in isopar M at 1 and 3 M HNO3 concentrations (Fig. 7) is close to 1.6, which corresponds to the cumulative proceeding of reactions (2), (5), (8), and (9). The slope coeﬃ cients a and the parameters log K0 of Eq. (7) presented in Table 1 evidence that the values of the parameters a of Eq. (7) practically do not diﬀ er for Yb and Lu, which notices that the separation factors of these elements are independent of the extractant concentration. The equilibrium constants of Eqs. (5) and (9) for Yb and Lu coincide and practically do not depend on the extractant concentration, which conﬁ rms the decrease in the separation factors of these elements at HNO3 concentrations above 2 M. At a lower concentration, the separation factors of the Yb/Lu pair increase and reach 1.4–1.6, which makes it possible to consider this extractant as an alternative to P507. At the same time, the low saturation of Cyanex-272 (Fig. 2) necessitates the use of Cyanex-272 only in a mixture with other extractants. The average error in calculating the distribution coeﬃ cients according to the model does not exceed 7–8 rel %.

Context:  Extraction systems for the separation of lutetium and ytterbium based on acidic organophosphorus extractants P507 and Cyanex-272 from nitric acid solutions have been studied. In the course of the experiments, results were found both with the use of a light diluent (Isopar M) and a heavy diluent F3. The separation factors of lutetium and ytterbium in the studied extraction systems are 1.4–1.6. The obtained experimental data on the extraction of lutetium and ytterbium with P507 were used to construct a mathematical model that makes it possible to predict the behavior of Yb and Lu in the extraction cascade. A special report will be devoted to testing technological regimes for the lutetium and ytterbium separation.
