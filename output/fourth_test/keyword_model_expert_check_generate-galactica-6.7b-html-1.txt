Context: The quality of the 64Ni solid target prepared above was evaluated by a number of physical techniques, to determine the uniformity, to characterize the metallic impurities, and to measure the thickness of 64Ni layer on Au-disk. The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image (Figure 2b) of the 64Ni solid target showed the uniform layer of Ni on Au surface. The EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) (Table 1 and Figure 2c) results showed no significant amount of metallic impurities in the 64Ni layer. The 64Ni target thickness on Au-disk was measured to be 10.73 μm by alpha step apparatus (Figure 2d).

Context: High purity reagents were used for production of 64Cu in this study. Isotopically enriched 64Ni (99.32% 64Ni; 0.13% 58Ni; 0.07% 60Ni; 0.01% 61Ni; 0.47% 62Ni) was from Isoflex Company (San Francisco, CA, USA); (NH4)2SO4 (99.999% metals basis) from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA); concentrated HCl (99.999% trace metals basis), HNO3 (99.999% trace metals basis), and NH4OH (99.99% trace metals basis) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); AG®1-X8 ion exchange resin was from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA); platinum wire (99.997% metals basis) from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA); Ni2+ analytical test strips from Qtantofix (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA); disposable PD-10 desalting columns were from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Context: After electroplating, the 64Ni solid target was examined by measuring 64Ni thickness, composition and structure. The thickness was measured by alpha step apparatus, the composition was measured by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and the structure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Meanwhile, the identity of metallic impurities of the 64Ni target was further analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

Context: As in Figure 2, in Figure 6 “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the isomer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. Figure 6 above plots the excitation functions of natFe(d,xn) reactions that form cobalt-58m/g and enriched iron-57 can be used to increase yields and purities. Using lower-energy deuterons reduces the likelihood of the 57Fe(d,2n)57Co reaction occurring, which has a threshold energy of 3.9 MeV [40]. Overall, an enriched iron-57 target reduces radioisotopic impurities within the cobalt-58m sample. The possible 57Co-producing reactions excitation functions are shown in Figure 7. Sudar and Qaim examined the production ratio of the ground and metastable isomers of cobalt-58 from deuteron irradiations of natural iron targets [29] based on the assumptions that deuteron capture and iron-58 target reactions’ contributions are small, but to our knowledge, no measurements have been made of the formation of cobalt-58m/g using separated iron-57.
 

Question: What resin/column is the solution loaded into during the above reaction?
Answer:: 'the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components', and an 'anion exchange column' is a resin/column, then an anion exchange column must be the resin/column.

Context: While not widely used for radiochemistry, early studies showed that cobalt can be separated from iron 3+ and nickel 2+ with the use of inorganic and organic absorbents [94]. Many of the inorganic separations were using alumina, a polar column chromatography absorbent [96]. The organic separations from iron 2+ and nickel 2+ rely on columns of 8-hydroxyquinoline, naphthaquinoline, and cupferron mixed with potato starch or dimethylglyoxime compound columns, as reported by Bate and Leddicotte, [94].

Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popular imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist peptides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding affinity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding affinity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110].

Context: Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.
