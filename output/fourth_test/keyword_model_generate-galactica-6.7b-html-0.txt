 Context: Copper-64 is a useful radioisotope for positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efficiently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

 Context: The quality of the 64Ni solid target prepared above was evaluated by a number of physical techniques, to determine the uniformity, to characterize the metallic impurities, and to measure the thickness of 64Ni layer on Au-disk. The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image (Figure 2b) of the 64Ni solid target showed the uniform layer of Ni on Au surface. The EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) (Table 1 and Figure 2c) results showed no significant amount of metallic impurities in the 64Ni layer. The 64Ni target thickness on Au-disk was measured to be 10.73 μm by alpha step apparatus (Figure 2d).

 Context: After irradiation of 5 h, the 64Ni target was dissolved in 6 M hydrochloride acid, and then the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components. The 64Ni was washed out with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling. Due to the elevated cost of enriched 64Ni, recycling of the target material for re-use could reduce the production cost of 64Cu, without sacrificing the quality of subsequent 64Cu production. When the eluted was switched to 1 M HCl, the first band coming out was co-produced cobalt radioisotopes (approximately 1 mL), and the second was the 64Cu, which was collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for further use. The separation process of 64Cu took about 2.5 h after irradiation.

 Context: The 64Ni targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the enriched 64Ni (99.32%) solution prepared as described above. Electroplating of 64Ni was realized using a plating vessel of our own design and manufacture (Figure 1), where the Au disk was used as a cathode and platinum wire as an anode. The electrodeposition of 64Ni was achieved at 2.4–2.6 V and 15–25 mA with the platinum anode at ~1 cm from the Au disk electrode. This process took 48–72 h. The enriched 64Ni target was irradiated at 12.5 MeV (which decreased by Al) with 20 μA current on a Sumitomo HM-20 cyclotron (20 MeV) for about 5–7 h. 64Cu was produced from the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction.

 Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradiation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

 Context: Cobalt-55 production was reported in 1938 from alpha irradiation of manganese [18] and has since been reported from many target materials and incident beams. Practically, two reactions are best suited for producing activities of cobalt-55 with few impurities: 58Ni(p,α)55Co and 54Fe(d,n)55Co, which are accessible on low energy cyclotrons [19].

 Context: The 58Ni(p,α)55Co reaction has been employed by many groups [14,21,22,23,24]. Several radioisotopic and radionuclidic impurities can be formed in this process. Cobalt-57(t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 1377 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is produced from 58Ni(p,2p)57Co above 15 MeV [23], and production of cobalt-56 occurs above 25 MeV [25]. Nickel-57 (t1/2 = 35.68 h, β+ = 44%, Eγ= 1377.6 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is primarily produced via the 58Ni(p,2p)57Cu, which decays to nickel-57 with a half-life of 196 ms [21]. This reaction occurs above the threshold of 12 MeV, and is useful for monitoring separation efficiency during process development. However, nickel-57 decays to cobalt-57, which cannot be separated from cobalt-55. Natural nickel targets can also be used, but result in increased impurities that limit downstream clinical work [26].

 Context: Deuteron bombardments can be used to produce cobalt-58m from enriched iron-57 via the (d,n) reaction, natural iron targets via the (d,n) reaction on iron-57 (2.2% abundance) or (d,2n) reaction on iron-56 (91.7%). Higher stopping power for deuterons reduces the quantity of isotopically enriched target material required, and deuteron-induced reactions’ excitation functions are often higher than similar reactions incited by proton beams. However, the relative thermal power density deposited in the target by the deuteron beam is higher than for protons. Accelerators with deuteron beams are also less common, and where they do exist, they usually have energies too low to utilize the entirety of even (d,n) excitation functions. Deuteron irradiations to produce cobalt-58m proceed on iron isotopes iron-57 and iron-58, which both exist in relatively low abundance, so as with proton irradiations, significant costs are associated with target materials.

 Context: As in Figure 2, in Figure 6 “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the isomer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. Figure 6 above plots the excitation functions of natFe(d,xn) reactions that form cobalt-58m/g and enriched iron-57 can be used to increase yields and purities. Using lower-energy deuterons reduces the likelihood of the 57Fe(d,2n)57Co reaction occurring, which has a threshold energy of 3.9 MeV [40]. Overall, an enriched iron-57 target reduces radioisotopic impurities within the cobalt-58m sample. The possible 57Co-producing reactions excitation functions are shown in Figure 7. Sudar and Qaim examined the production ratio of the ground and metastable isomers of cobalt-58 from deuteron irradiations of natural iron targets [29] based on the assumptions that deuteron capture and iron-58 target reactions’ contributions are small, but to our knowledge, no measurements have been made of the formation of cobalt-58m/g using separated iron-57.

 Context: Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations. These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts. A comparison of the experimentally determined thick target yields and theoretical yields are shown in Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16.

 Context: To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelerator capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

 Context: Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 μL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell.

 Context: Another form of target fabrication is to press elemental enriched iron into 5 mm diameter pellets. Enriched iron material can come in the form of Fe2O3. If made from the oxide form, the target will have poor thermal conductivity. Therefore, the enriched Fe2O3 is reduced to elemental form by heating the powder at 800 °C for 4 h in a hydrogen tube furnace [86].

 Context: Because both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m require isolation from iron or nickel target materials, many of the radiochemical isolation processes reported can be applied to multiple production schemes. Several anion-exchange resins such as Dowex-2, Amberlite IRA-400, and ANEX-L have been historically used for the separation of Co from various transition metals in HCl, HNO3, and HBr solutions [94].

 Context: Previously reported separation methods to remove nickel from cobalt used the AG 1 × 8 anion-exchange resin [14,24]. These methods included the use of multiple grams of resin packed into a glass column and equilibrated with 9 M HCl. The dissolved target solution in 9M HCl was loaded onto the column where the nickel elutes from the column in the eluate and 9M HCl wash in 10–40 mL. The cobalt-5x, which remains on the column during the large 9M HCl wash, is eluted from the column in 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl. The eluted cobalt fraction can then be evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in various matrices for further analysis and/or radiolabeling experiments.

 Context: Anion-exchange chromatography also isolates cobalt-5x from iron target material [94]. After dissolving the target in acid, the iron is oxidized into the 3+ state with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of loading the cobalt-5x on to the anion-exchange resin and washing away the target material, as was performed in the nickel/cobalt anion-exchange separation, cobalt and iron are retained on the column when loaded. The cobalt can then be eluted form the anion-exchange column in 4 M HCl. The iron target will remain on the column during the 4 M HCl wash, but can be recovered in low concentrations of HCl. The HCl eluant containing cobalt-5x can also be evaporated and the cobalt-5x reconstituted in alternative matrices without incurring significant losses [26,28,86,87].

 Context: As stated by Valdovinos et al., it is preferrable to use extraction chromatography instead of traditional ion exchange resins to increase separation yield and purity level [26]. This realization allowed for the implementation of N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-2-ethylhexyldiglycolamide (DGA Branched extraction resin). The most recent published separation methods from both nickel and iron targets of varying enrichments use branched DGA to chemically isolate radioactive cobalt.

Many of the inorganic separations were using alumina, a polar column chromatography absorbent [96].

 Context: The somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are a family of 5 G protein-coupled receptors that contain somatostatin-binding extracellular domains [101]. Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102]. Variations of somatostatin have been developed to bind to the SSTRs for the detection and treatment of cancers. These analogs deviate from the base structure of SST in ways that increase binding specificity and plasma stability [103].

 Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popular imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist peptides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding affinity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding affinity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110].

 Context: Folate receptors (FR) are expressed on the surface of cells and reduce extracellular folic acid derivatives, delivering them across the cell membrane [119]. Their overexpression by many cancers makes them interesting pharmacological targets [119,120]. Radford et al. 55Co-labeled two folate receptor-targeting constructs, cm10 (DOTA tagged) and rf42 (NODAGA tagged) [121]. In vitro and in vivo up uptake waweres evaluated in the KB cervical cancer cell line which expresses high levels of FR [122]. The two agents had similar uptake and biodistributions, achieving >15% ID/g in xenografted tumors and underwent renal clearance [121]. Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu-labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124].

 Context: Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.

 Context: Further investigation into the ZHER3 affibody involved modifying the chelator to determine if imaging qualities could be improved [135]. In addition to NOTA, which was used previously, DOTA-, NODAGA-, and DOTAGA-tagged ZHER3 were 57Co labeled. In vitro assays showed nearly equal, blockable binding of the affibody conjugated DOTA, NODAGA, and DOTAGA. The measured equilibrium disassociation constants, KD, were 0.2 nM for DOTA and DOTAGA constructs and 0.1 nM for the NOTA and NODAGA constructs. Interestingly, the internalization fraction of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 in DU145 cells was observed to be 5% over 24 h, while their previous study showed as compared to 50% in their previous study [134]. In vivo, [57Co]Co-(NOTA/NODAGA/DOTA/DOTAGA)-ZHER3 were compared at 3 h and 24 h PI. The DOTA- and DOTAGA-conjugated affibodies showed more rapid blood clearance than those labeled with NOTA and NODAGA. [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was compared to [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 at 3 h post injection and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was followed to 24 h (see Figure 21 below). At 3 h, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor uptake but lower blood, liver, and small intestine uptake. By 24 h, [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor to organ ratios as 68Ga at 3 h PI [135].
