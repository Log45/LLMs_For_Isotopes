Context: The quality of the 64Ni solid target prepared above was evaluated by a number of physical techniques, to determine the uniformity, to characterize the metallic impurities, and to measure the thickness of 64Ni layer on Au-disk. The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image (Figure 2b) of the 64Ni solid target showed the uniform layer of Ni on Au surface. The EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) (Table 1 and Figure 2c) results showed no significant amount of metallic impurities in the 64Ni layer. The 64Ni target thickness on Au-disk was measured to be 10.73 μm by alpha step apparatus (Figure 2d).

Context: Cobalt-55 production was reported in 1938 from alpha irradiation of manganese [18] and has since been reported from many target materials and incident beams. Practically, two reactions are best suited for producing activities of cobalt-55 with few impurities: 58Ni(p,α)55Co and 54Fe(d,n)55Co, which are accessible on low energy cyclotrons [19]. These reactions have been thoroughly and recently reviewed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and significant independent efforts resulting in recommended excitation functions for the reactions discussed below [20].

Question: What are the products of the above reaction?
Answer:er: 58Ni(p,α)55Co and 54Fe(d,n)55Co.
Score: 6.9

Question: What resin/column is the solution loaded into during the above reaction?
Answer:er: 1. Since they say: 'the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components', and an 'anion exchange column' is a resin/column, then an anion exchange column must be the resin/

Context: While there has not been a publication specifically on the separation of manganese target material from cobalt-55,58m, the work performed by Pourmand et al. suggests branched DGA can also be used for radio-chemical isolation using 4–6 M HCl, where in this range manganese 2+ has minimal affinity for the resin, and cobalt 2+ has a greater affinity [95].
 

Question: What is the target material in the above reaction?
Answer:er: 55Co, or Cobalt-55, must be the target.

Context: Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.
