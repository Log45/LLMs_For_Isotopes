Copper-64 is a useful radioisotope for positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efficiently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

A number of radiotracers involving 64Cu as radionuclide have been applied in nuclear medicine as a means of studying their PET imaging [4,5,6]. Incorporation of 64Cu into diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (ATSM) ligand was used for PET hypoxia imaging, such as in head and neck cancer, and cardiac conditions [7,8]. More radiotracers are in clinical development [9,10,11,12], especially those with peptides and antibodies. For example, 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab was used to conduct PET imaging of HER2-positive lesions in patients with primary and metastatic breast cancer [13]. The PET image of 64Cu-DOTATATE provided superior image quality, and detected more lesions than 111In-DTPA-octreotide [14]. Grubmüller, B. et al. investigated the diagnostic potential of 64Cu-PSMA-617 in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma [15].

The quality of 64Cu produced was evaluated by analysis of its metallic impurities and measurement of half-life of its radioactivity. The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was used to evaluate the amount of metallic impurities in a decayed 64Cu solution, and showed a concentration of 6.339 ppb of Ni (0.127 μg), 4.112 ppb of Cu (0.082 μg), 5.502 ppb of Zn (0.110 μg), 0.108 ppb of Fe (0.002 μg), 0.102 ppb of Co (0.002 μg), 0.669 ppb of Ga (0.013 μg). The gamma spectrum of the produced 64CuCl2 solution (Figure 3) showed that the 64Cu radionuclide purity was >99%. The half-life of the produced radioactivity was determined by the radioactivity measured at different time points into the following equations:A=A0e−λt, lnA=−λt+lnA0, lnAA0=−λtA=A0e−λt, lnA=−λt+lnA0, lnAA0=−λt(1)where A is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at time t, A0 is the radioactivity of the 64Cu at 0 h, and λ represents the constant. We obtained the following equation (Figure 4):lnA=−0.05456t+5.438lnA=−0.05456t+5.438(2)when t=T1/2t=T1/2, the A=12A0A=12A0ln12=−0.05456T1/2ln12=−0.05456T1/2(3)

In this study, we presented the improved method for the preparation of 64Cu, especially the improved efficiency of electroplating of 64Ni. The 64Ni solid target on an Au-disk has a uniform surface, with the thickness of 10.73 μm, and no metallic impurities. The total plated 64Ni was 70.6 ± 5.8 mg and the density of the plated 64Ni was 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2 (assuming a uniform thickness). After irradiation of the target and purification, the gamma spectrum of the produced 64Cu showed its radionuclide purity to be >99%, with both peaks at 511 keV and 1346 keV. In addition, the produced 64CuCl2 solution has high specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into the modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was further used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

The emerging success of [68Ga/177Lu]Ga/Lu-DOTATATE as a theranostic pair has spurred interest in other isotopes as potential theranostic combinations. Here, we review cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m as a potential theranostic pair. Radionuclidically pure cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m have been produced on small cyclotrons with high molar activity. In vitro, DOTATOC labeled with cobalt has shown greater affinity for SSTR2 than DOTATOC labeled with gallium and yttrium. Similarly, [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE has shown improved cell-killing capabilities as compared to DOTATATE labeled with either indium-111 or lutetium-177. Finally, PET imaging with an isotope such as cobalt-55 allows for image acquisition at much later timepoints than gallium, allowing for an increased degree of biological clearance of non-bound radiotracer. We discuss the accelerator targetry and radiochemistry used to produce cobalt-55,58m, emphasizing the implications of these techniques to downstream radiotracers being developed for imaging and therapy.

Radiopharmaceuticals are clinically useful for the diagnosis and treatment of disease [1,2,3,4,5]. However, quantifying radiopharmaceuticals’ dosimetry is challenging [6]. Matching diagnostic radionuclides with chemically similar therapeutics creates a “theranostic” pair, helping to resolve this problem [7]. The success of theranostic pairs has led to the re-evaluation of several radionuclides as potential radiopharmaceuticals, with the most popular in recent times being gallium-68 (t1/2 = 68 min, β+ = 89%, Emax= 1899 keV) and lutetium-177 (t1/2 = 6.7 d, Eβ- = 134 keV) [8]. The availability of both gallium-68 and lutetium-177 and the success of conjugating a myriad of targeting vectors to them have led to their widespread adoption in the nuclear medicine community. However, several shortcomings exist for these two radionuclides; namely, the short half-life of gallium-68 limits the range of its applicability, and the resistance of some cancers to lutetium-177-labelled radiopharmaceuticals has prompted a search for other therapeutic radionuclides [9]. Additionally, although gallium-68 and lutetium-177 have been used as a theranostic pair, slight chemical differences between the two may complicate dosimetric calculations and/or lead to subtle biological incongruities [10]. Using compounds labelled with the same chemical element can obviate this problem and allow the same protocols to be used in forming and purifying chemical complexes [11]. Cobalt-55 (t1/2 = 17.53 h, β+ = 77%, Eγ = 931.1 keV, Iγ = 75%) and cobalt-58m (t1/2 = 9.10 h, IC= 100%) are one of the most promising of such pairs identified due to their identical chemical properties coupled to similar half-lives and high in vivo stability and compatibility with many chelators which can be coupled with targeting biomolecules [8,12,13,14,15,16,17]. We review the production and application of cobalt-55,58m with emphasis placed on potential translational and clinical applications.

A summary of molar activities obtained for the targeting paradigms discussed above is included in Table 3 below. Cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are ideally suited as a matched-pair theranostic for use in both research and clinical environments. A wide range of production pathways are available for cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m with distinct advantages to each method. For use in clinical applications, enriched targets coupled with modern cyclotrons are likely the best path forward since this method can result in high radiochemical purities (>98%). Furthermore, the literature for chelating cobalt-58m was reviewed and results compared with clinically approved and other contemporary radiopharmaceuticals. In many of the applications reported, cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are at least comparable to gallium-68 and lutetium-177 with some studies also reporting superior contrast with cobalt-55 over gallium-68 and higher cell-killing efficiencies with cobalt-58m as compared to lutetium-177. However, despite the favorable results, there have not been any in vivo human trials using cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m in targeted radionuclide therapy and thus further studies are necessary.

Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradiation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

The 58Ni(p,α)55Co reaction has been employed by many groups [14,21,22,23,24]. Several radioisotopic and radionuclidic impurities can be formed in this process. Cobalt-57(t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 1377 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is produced from 58Ni(p,2p)57Co above 15 MeV [23], and production of cobalt-56 occurs above 25 MeV [25]. Nickel-57 (t1/2 = 35.68 h, β+ = 44%, Eγ= 1377.6 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is primarily produced via the 58Ni(p,2p)57Cu, which decays to nickel-57 with a half-life of 196 ms [21]. This reaction occurs above the threshold of 12 MeV, and is useful for monitoring separation efficiency during process development. However, nickel-57 decays to cobalt-57, which cannot be separated from cobalt-55. Natural nickel targets can also be used, but result in increased impurities that limit downstream clinical work [26].

Theoretically, this method affords radioisotopically pure cobalt-55 compared with the proton-induced route described above, avoiding cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Practically, purities are limited by the achievable enrichment of the iron-56 target. The excitation function peaks near 7 MeV (Figure 1) [28].

Proton bombardment of iron-54 leads to the production of very short-lived contaminants such as 54Fe(p,n)54Co (t1/2 = 1.46 m) and 54Fe(p,2n)53Co (t1/2 = 0.24 s) that do not diminish the radioisotopic purity of cobalt-58m. However, higher-energy proton reactions on iron-56 and iron-57, as described above for iron-58, may form longer-lived radioisotopic impurities cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Measured data from the relevant excitation functions are shown below in Figure 4 and Figure 5.

Deuteron bombardments can be used to produce cobalt-58m from enriched iron-57 via the (d,n) reaction, natural iron targets via the (d,n) reaction on iron-57 (2.2% abundance) or (d,2n) reaction on iron-56 (91.7%). Higher stopping power for deuterons reduces the quantity of isotopically enriched target material required, and deuteron-induced reactions’ excitation functions are often higher than similar reactions incited by proton beams. However, the relative thermal power density deposited in the target by the deuteron beam is higher than for protons. Accelerators with deuteron beams are also less common, and where they do exist, they usually have energies too low to utilize the entirety of even (d,n) excitation functions. Deuteron irradiations to produce cobalt-58m proceed on iron isotopes iron-57 and iron-58, which both exist in relatively low abundance, so as with proton irradiations, significant costs are associated with target materials.

As in Figure 2, in Figure 6 “m” indicates measurements of the direct formation of cobalt-58m, “c” indicates cumulative formation of cobalt-58g either after the complete decay of the isomer or with simultaneous accounting for the contribution from cobalt-58m decay, and “i” indicates measurement of the independent formation of cobalt-58g without contribution from cobalt-58m. Figure 6 above plots the excitation functions of natFe(d,xn) reactions that form cobalt-58m/g and enriched iron-57 can be used to increase yields and purities. Using lower-energy deuterons reduces the likelihood of the 57Fe(d,2n)57Co reaction occurring, which has a threshold energy of 3.9 MeV [40]. Overall, an enriched iron-57 target reduces radioisotopic impurities within the cobalt-58m sample. The possible 57Co-producing reactions excitation functions are shown in Figure 7. Sudar and Qaim examined the production ratio of the ground and metastable isomers of cobalt-58 from deuteron irradiations of natural iron targets [29] based on the assumptions that deuteron capture and iron-58 target reactions’ contributions are small, but to our knowledge, no measurements have been made of the formation of cobalt-58m/g using separated iron-57.

In addition to charged particle-induced reactions, several alternative and less pragmatic routes to cobalt-58m can be contemplated, e.g., quasi-monoenergetic neutron or triton irradiations. Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons can be produced via 2H(d,n)3He reaction on hydrogen-2 gas targets. The neutrons bombard nickel or cobalt induce the 58Ni(n,p)58mCo and 59Co(n,2n)58mCo reactions [29,75]. Tritons can be generated via the 6Li(n,α)3H reaction within a nuclear reactor with an energy of 2.736 MeV. These ions go on to bombard [56Fe]Fe2O3 targets to produce cobalt-58m,g via the 56Fe(t,n)58mCo reaction route [76,85]. These alternative reactions currently rely on rare accelerator infrastructure or on significantly increased scale in terms of beam intensities.

As mentioned above, the co-production of cobalt-58g with cobalt-58m is unavoidable.

This impurity poses an issue to the application of cobalt-58m due its long half-life and concomitant gamma emissions [88]. However, cobalt-58g can be useful for PET imaging of the biodistribution of radiolabeled agents.

Using the table above, it can be suggested that for the production of cobalt-55, iron-54 targets should be utilized based on the lack of potential long-lived radio-contaminants co-produced, and an increased yield at lower thickness targets when compared to yields produced by nickel-58.

To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelerator capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation. Figure 6 does not show the yield for an enriched target; the plotted value should be scaled to account for the natural abundance of iron-57.

Anion-exchange chromatography also isolates cobalt-5x from iron target material [94]. After dissolving the target in acid, the iron is oxidized into the 3+ state with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of loading the cobalt-5x on to the anion-exchange resin and washing away the target material, as was performed in the nickel/cobalt anion-exchange separation, cobalt and iron are retained on the column when loaded. The cobalt can then be eluted form the anion-exchange column in 4 M HCl. The iron target will remain on the column during the 4 M HCl wash, but can be recovered in low concentrations of HCl.

Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102]. Variations of somatostatin have been developed to bind to the SSTRs for the detection and treatment of cancers.

Thisgaard et al. followed this work with a comparative in vivo evaluation of 57Co-labeled DOTATOC, DOTANOC, and DOTATATE with [111In]In-DOTATATE [107]. In a head-to-head comparison in AR42J cells, the three 57Co-labeled somatostatin analogues were found to have between 49 and 123% higher cellular uptake as compared to [111In]In-DOTATATE. All agents showed similar levels of nuclear translocation, with less than 10% of nuclear translocation observed up to 3 h post addition. The cell-killing ability of the Auger emitter [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was also compared to the beta emitter [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE and the Auger emitter [111In]In-DOTATATE. At low concentrations, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was more effective in causing DNA damage than 111In-labeled or 177Lu-labeled, while at higher concentrations the [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE was most effective. When the cell-killing assay was normalized to cumulative decays, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was consistently most effective at all concentrations tested. The authors attributed the limited degree of cell killing demonstrated by lutetium-177 to the cells being grown in monolayer, which restricts the ability of the emitted electrons to cross into adjacent cells to do damage. The superiority of 58mCo-over 111In-labeled DOTATATE may also be attributed to the higher binding affinity of the cobalt-labeled DOTATATE for SSTR2. Similarly to the 2008 study, the authors performed a biodistribution study with [57Co]Co-DOTATATE and found high tumor uptake 1–4 h PI. By 4 h, most uptake in organs with SSTR2 expression such as the stomach and pancreas had greatly decreased [106].

The first cobalt-55 imaging of GRPR was reported in 2016 by Dam et al. [111] and compared 55Co-, 57Co-, and 68Ga-labeled GRPR agonist NOTA-AMBA (NOTA-Gly-4-ABz-Gln-Trp-Ala-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2) in a PC3 prostate cancer. 57Co- and 68Ga-labeled NOTA-AMBA were found to have similar receptor affinities, serum stabilities, and pharmacokinetics at 1 h and 4 h PI [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA enabled PET imaging at a 24 h timepoint (and beyond) which is not possible with [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-AMBA and revealed encouraging clearance of the tracer and stable late uptake of [5xCo]Co-NOTA-AMBA in the tumor [111].

The IC50 for Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (5.54 ± 0.4 nM) [10] is approximately 10-fold higher than Co-NOTA-AMBA (0.46 ± 0.20 nM) [13,111]. In vivo comparisons between [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA and [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 are complicated as the early imaging times are not matched between studies. However, comparison at the 24 h timepoint shows greater uptake of [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA than [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 in the tumor as well as many other organs. Even though the tumor uptake was less, the tumor to organ ratios for [57Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 were sometimes 100-fold greater than what was observed with [57Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA. This was most notable in tissues with high GRPR expression such as the colon, pancreas, and stomach. The 24 h PI PET images provided, with both papers similarly showing lower non-target organ accumulation with the [55Co]Co-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 than with [55Co]Co-NOTA-AMBA.

Like HER2, HER3 is overexpressed by certain cancer types. Additionally, HER3 expression changes in response to therapy, increasing in tissues as they become resistant to HER2 targeted therapies [132]. As immunotherapies to HER3 are developed, it becomes important to develop tools to detect HER3 status in tumors [133]. Hence, an affibody which targets HER3 (HEHEHE-ZHER3) was conjugated with NOTA and radiolabeled with 57Co [134]. In vitro, incubation of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 with cells expressing low HER3 (DU145) and high HER3 (LS174T) showed better total binding to LS174T (~15% vs. 4% for DU145). Internalization was observed to be higher with the DU145 cells, with approximately 50% of activity internalized by DU145 at 24 h, and less than 10% internalization seen with LS174T. As expected, the high expression line LS174T showed greater tumor binding in vivo, which was effectively blocked with non-labeled ZHER3. Uptake was also seen in tissues which have endogenous expression of HER3, namely the liver and intestines. Clearance occurred primarily through the kidneys. By 24 h PI, imaging showed that much of the activity in the liver and intestines had cleared [134].

Recently, Mitran et al. investigated the impact chelator modification had on PEG2-RM26 cell binding, internalization, and biodistribution in PC-3 prostate cancer [113]. PEG2-RM26 was bound to NOTA, DOTA, NODAGA, or DOTAGA and radiolabeled with cobalt-55 and cobalt-57. The NOTA- and DOTA-labeled peptides showed the highest uptake in PC-3 cells in vitro and DOTA-labeled peptide had the highest tumor uptake in vivo by 24 h PI. In PET imaging studies, NOTA and DOTA PEG2-RM26 showed near-complete clearance of the radiotracer from the kidneys and GI tract by 24 h, whereas NODAGA and DOTAGA had residual GI and kidney uptake respectively.

In summary, cobalt-labeled GRPR targeting agonist and antagonist peptides successfully imaged PC3 prostate cancers. Therapy using a GRPR agonist peptide radiolabeled with cobalt-58m may be possible but would likely be limited by high uptake in non-target organs. Therapy with an antagonist remains to be determined but may suffer from low cellular internalization.

More recently, bombesin analogues have been supplanted by prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting agents in prostate cancer imaging, culminating in the NDA approval for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 [114,115,116]. In 2017, Dam et al. compared 68Ga and 55/57Co-labeled PSMA-617 with in vitro-specific binding and internalization assays in LNCaP and PC3-PIP cells [12]. Observed KD values for both agents were similar to [111In]In-PSMA-617 [117]. In LNCaP cells incubated with [57Co]CoPSMA-617, >60% of the cell associated radioactivity was internalized after 30 min of incubation, which was higher than 68Ga-, 177Lu-, or 44Sc-labeled PSMA-617 [117,118]. PET imaging with [55Co]Co-PSMA-617 shows selective tumor uptake by 20 min P.I. and was sustained at 24 h PI. Additionally, by 24 h, tumor uptake was found to be higher than any other organ, including the kidneys [12].

Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.

With that in mind, an affibody for HER2 (DOTA-Z2395-C) was developed and 57Co-labeled (as a substitute for cobalt-55) [130]. In vitro studies with the 57Co-labeled HER2 affibody revealed that radiolabeling conditions only slightly reduced immunoreactivity of the affibody. In vitro, approximately 20% of the tracer internalized over 24 h in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, biodistribution was similar to what was observed with [111In]In-DOTA-Z2395-C [131]. Blood clearance was rapid, falling from 0.5 to 0.027 % ID/g between 1 and 24 h PI. SPECT imaging of [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C at 4 h PI in mice bearing LS174T tumors (low HER2) and SKOV-3 tumors (high HER-2) revealed blockable tumor uptake and kidney clearance [130].
