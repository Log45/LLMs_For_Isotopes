Context: The quality of the 64Ni solid target prepared above was evaluated by a number of physical techniques, to determine the uniformity, to characterize the metallic impurities, and to measure the thickness of 64Ni layer on Au-disk. The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image (Figure 2b) of the 64Ni solid target showed the uniform layer of Ni on Au surface. The EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) (Table 1 and Figure 2c) results showed no significant amount of metallic impurities in the 64Ni layer. The 64Ni target thickness on Au-disk was measured to be 10.73 μm by alpha step apparatus (Figure 2d).

Context: The 64Ni electroplating solution was prepared as reported previously with some modifications [25]. The enriched 64Ni metal (65–80 mg) was dissolved in 5 mL of warm 6 M HNO3. After the metal was completely dissolved, the solution was then evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The green-colored residue was dissolved in 300 µL of concentrated H2SO4 and the solution then diluted with 2 mL of 18 MΩ·cm water (Milli-Q Waters, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) slowly and carefully. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 9.05 ± 0.05 by adding about 1.5 mL concentrated NH4OH. To this solution, ~300 mg of (NH4)2SO4 was added and the volume of the solution was adjusted to 5 mL with 18 MΩ·cm water. The final solution was transferred to the electroplating cell for target plating.

Context: The 64Ni targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the enriched 64Ni (99.32%) solution prepared as described above. Electroplating of 64Ni was realized using a plating vessel of our own design and manufacture (Figure 1), where the Au disk was used as a cathode and platinum wire as an anode. The electrodeposition of 64Ni was achieved at 2.4–2.6 V and 15–25 mA with the platinum anode at ~1 cm from the Au disk electrode. This process took 48–72 h. The enriched 64Ni target was irradiated at 12.5 MeV (which decreased by Al) with 20 μA current on a Sumitomo HM-20 cyclotron (20 MeV) for about 5–7 h. 64Cu was produced from the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction.

Context: Overall, while the high cross section of 55Mn(α,n)58mCo makes it appealing, the 58Fe(p,n)58mCo and 57Fe(d,n)58mCo reactions are more practical for widespread use due to the accessibility of protons and deuterons in global accelerator installations. These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts.

Context: Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 µL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell.

Context: Another form of target fabrication is to press elemental enriched iron into 5 mm diameter pellets. Enriched iron material can come in the form of Fe2O3. If made from the oxide form, the target will have poor thermal conductivity.

Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102]. Variations of somatostatin have been developed to bind to the SSTRs for the detection and treatment of cancers. These analogs deviate from the base structure of SST in ways that increase binding specificity and plasma stability [103].

Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popular imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist peptides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding affinity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding affinity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110].

Context: Folate receptors (FR) are expressed on the surface of cells and reduce extracellular folic acid derivatives, delivering them across the cell membrane [119]. Their overexpression by many cancers makes them interesting pharmacological targets [119,120]. Radford et al. 55Co-labeled two folate receptor-targeting constructs, cm10 (DOTA tagged) and rf42 (NODAGA tagged) [121]. In vitro and in vivo up uptake waweres evaluated in the KB cervical cancer cell line which expresses high levels of FR [122]. The two agents had similar uptake and biodistributions, achieving >15% ID/g in xenografted tumors and underwent renal clearance [121]. Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu-labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124].

Context: Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.
 

Question: What is the target material in the above reaction?
Answer:The target material is the albumin-binding domain of the folate receptor-targeted therapy.

Context: Further investigation into the ZHER3 affibody involved modifying the chelator to determine if imaging qualities could be improved [135]. In addition to NOTA, which was used previously, DOTA-, NODAGA-, and DOTAGA-tagged ZHER3 were 57Co labeled. In vitro assays showed nearly equal, blockable binding of the affibody conjugated DOTA, NODAGA, and DOTAGA. The measured equilibrium disassociation constants, KD, were 0.2 nM for DOTA and DOTAGA constructs and 0.1 nM for the NOTA and NODAGA constructs. Interestingly, the internalization fraction of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 in DU145 cells was observed to be 5% over 24 h, while their previous study showed as compared to 50% in their previous study [134]. In vivo, [57Co]Co-(NOTA/NODAGA/DOTA/DOTAGA)-ZHER3 were compared at 3 h and 24 h PI. The DOTA- and DOTAGA-conjugated affibodies showed more rapid blood clearance than those labeled with NOTA and NODAGA. [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was compared to [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 at 3 h post injection and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was followed to 24 h (see Figure 21 below). At 3 h, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor uptake but lower blood, liver, and small intestine uptake. By 24 h, [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor to organ ratios as 68Ga at 3 h PI [135].
