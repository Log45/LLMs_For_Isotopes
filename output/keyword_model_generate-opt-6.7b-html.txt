Context: Copper-64 is a useful radioisotope for positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the wide range of applications, the demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities is increasing. Here we report a simple method for the efficient production of high specific activity 64Cu using a cyclotron for biomedical application. We designed new equipment based on the plating of enriched 64Ni as the target, and used automated ion exchange chromatography to purify copper-64 efficiently after irradiation and dissolution of the target in good radiochemical and chemical yield and purity. The 64Cu radionuclide produced using 99.32% enriched 64Ni with a density of 61.4 ± 5.0 mg/cm2, reaching a total radioactivity greater than 200 mCi, with specific activity up to 5.6 GBq/μmoL. It was further incorporated into modified monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab to synthesize 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, which was used successfully for micro-PET imaging.

Context: After irradiation of 5 h, the 64Ni target was dissolved in 6 M hydrochloride acid, and then the solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components. The 64Ni was washed out with 6 M HCl and collected for recycling. Due to the elevated cost of enriched 64Ni, recycling of the target material for re-use could reduce the production cost of 64Cu, without sacrificing the quality of subsequent 64Cu production. When the eluted was switched to 1 M HCl, the first band coming out was co-produced cobalt radioisotopes (approximately 1 mL), and the second was the 64Cu, which was collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 0.1 M HCl for further use. The separation process of 64Cu took about 2.5 h after irradiation.

Context: Both cobalt-55 and cobalt-58m are produced primarily from charged particle irradiation of iron or nickel targets. The availability of deuterons likely increases the purity of achievable cobalt-55 but has less bearing on the production of cobalt-58m except for from a target material cost perspective. Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17].

Context: The 58Ni(p,α)55Co reaction has been employed by many groups [14,21,22,23,24]. Several radioisotopic and radionuclidic impurities can be formed in this process. Cobalt-57(t1/2 = 271.7 d, Eγ= 1377 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is produced from 58Ni(p,2p)57Co above 15 MeV [23], and production of cobalt-56 occurs above 25 MeV [25]. Nickel-57 (t1/2 = 35.68 h, β+ = 44%, Eγ= 1377.6 keV, Iγ = 81.7%) is primarily produced via the 58Ni(p,2p)57Cu, which decays to nickel-57 with a half-life of 196 ms [21]. This reaction occurs above the threshold of 12 MeV, and is useful for monitoring separation efficiency during process development. However, nickel-57 decays to cobalt-57, which cannot be separated from cobalt-55. Natural nickel targets can also be used, but result in increased impurities that limit downstream clinical work [26].

Context: Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 µL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell.

Context: The somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are a family of 5 G protein-coupled receptors that contain somatostatin-binding extracellular domains [101]. Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102]. Variations of somatostatin have been developed to bind to the SSTRs for the detection and treatment of cancers. These analogs deviate from the base structure of SST in ways that increase binding specificity and plasma stability [103].

Context: The cell surface protein gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) has become a popular imaging target in recent years. GRPR is overexpressed by a large number of cancers including prostate, pancreatic, colon, and non-small cell lung cancers [108]. Agonist peptides such as bombesin bind to GRPR, trigger downstream signaling and are subsequently internalized into the cell. They have higher binding affinity than antagonists and are taken up in organs with endogenous GRPR expression such as the pancreas, stomach, intestines and adrenal glands [109]. The lower binding affinity of GRPR antagonists, however, may be advantageous for imaging studies as it leads to lower uptake in normal tissues [110].

Context: Folate receptors (FR) are expressed on the surface of cells and reduce extracellular folic acid derivatives, delivering them across the cell membrane [119]. Their overexpression by many cancers makes them interesting pharmacological targets [119,120]. Radford et al. 55Co-labeled two folate receptor-targeting constructs, cm10 (DOTA tagged) and rf42 (NODAGA tagged) [121]. In vitro and in vivo up uptake waweres evaluated in the KB cervical cancer cell line which expresses high levels of FR [122]. The two agents had similar uptake and biodistributions, achieving >15% ID/g in xenografted tumors and underwent renal clearance [121]. Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu-labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124].

Context: Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.
