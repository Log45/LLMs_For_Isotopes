Context:  The quality of the 64Ni solid target prepared above was evaluated by a number of physical
 

Question: What is the target material in the above reaction?
Answer: 64Ni is a metal, so it is a metal ion. The metal ion can be loaded into a metal ion exchange resin.

Question: What acid is the target material dissolved in during the above reaction?
Answerr: 64Cu is produced by the 64Ni(p,n)64Cu reaction.

Question: What resin/column is the solution loaded into during the above reaction?
Answer: 'The solution was load to an anion exchange column to separate into different components'.

Question: What acid is used in the elution during the above reaction?
Answerswer: 55Co is produced by neutron capture on 54Mn, and 58Co is produced by neutron capture on 56Fe.

Question: What are the products of the above reaction?
Answe Answer: 1 M HCl.



Context:  Further investigation into the ZHER3 affibody involved modifying the chelator to determine if imaging qualities could be improved [135]. In addition to NOTA, which was used previously, DOTA-, NODAGA-, and DOTAGA-tagged ZHER3 were 57Co labeled. In vitro assays showed nearly equal, blockable binding of the affibody conjugated DOTA, NODAGA, and DOTAGA. The measured equilibrium disassociation constants, KD, were 0.2 nM for DOTA and DOTAGA constructs and 0.1 nM for the NOTA and NODAGA con- structs. Interestingly, the internalization fraction of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 in DU145 cells was observed to be 5% over 24 h, while their previous study showed as compared to 50% in their previous study [134]. In vivo, [57Co]Co-(NOTA/NODAGA/DOTA/DOTAGA)- ZHER3 were compared at 3 h and 24 h PI. The DOTA- and DOTAGA-conjugated affibod- ies showed more rapid blood clearance than those labeled with NOTA and NODAGA. [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was compared to [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 at 3 h post injection and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was followed to 24 h (see Figure 21 below). At 3 h, [68Ga]Ga- NODAGA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor uptake but lower blood, liver, and small intestine uptake. By 24 h, [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor to organ ratios as 68Ga at 3 h PI [135]. Figure 21. Chemical structures and charges of studied cobalt-chelate complexes (A). SPECT/CT images of the [57Co]Co- HEHEHE-ZHER3-X affibody with NOTA, NODAGA, or DOTA chelator (B). For each agent tested, the later imaging timepoint produced better tumor contrast. PET/CT of [68Ga]Ga-HEHEHE-ZHER3-NODATA was only possible to 3 h PI and showed greater kidney accumulation (C) [135]. The anti-HER2 [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C and anti HER3 [57Co]Co-ZHER3 affibodies showed promising tumor uptake, rapid blood clearance, and good imaging properties in the models tested. They would very likely translate well for labeling with 55Co for PET imaging. As a potential therapeutic, a 58mCo-labeled HER2/HER3 affibody may not show significant internalization needed for effective therapeutic response.
 

Question: What is the target material in the above reaction?
Answer Answer: [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was loaded into a 1 mL disposable syringe with a 22-gauge needle. The syringe was then connected to a 1 mL disposable syringe with a 27-gauge

Question: What acid is the target material dissolved in during the above reaction?
Answer Answer: 1 M HCl is used in the elution.
